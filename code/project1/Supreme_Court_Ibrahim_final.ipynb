    "Outputs for Supreme Court project: State or country, geometry, color.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of this project is to build a database of Supreme Court cases for 2016 that includes the dialogue from the oral arguments of each case. As we have seen in class the arguments were scraped from this page: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript.aspx \n",
    "\n",
    "I have already downloaded and transformed the PDFs of the transcripts into text documents which you can download from courseworks: supreme_court_pdfs_txt.zip\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three steps that you need to complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note:** Step 3 is the most challenging--if you want to spend some time coding, you can skip Steps 1 and 2 and get to work on Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 1:** scrape all of the case information available on this page: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript.aspx \n",
    "\n",
    "This should include case name, docket number, etc--and most importantly the name of the PDF file. All of the text files share the exact same name as the PDF files they came from. This file name will allow you to connect your transcription data with your case data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is up to you what kind Data structure you want to build. But it likely to be a list of lists, or list of dictionaries--for each case you will have a list or dictionary of the information you scrape from the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 2:** find a secondary source to scrape/integrate with your case data. The information on the Supreme Court page is very limited. You need to find a source or group of sources that ad information. The most important information would likely be: the decision, who voted for and against, and the state of origin of the case (for geocoding). You might think of other great things to put in there too! This information needs to be merged with the data you have from STEP 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 3:** use regular expressions to clean up and parse the text files so that you have a searchable data structure containing the dialog from the transcripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a data architecture perspective, you probably want to have a separate list for each case and in each list a data structure that pairs the speaker with what she/he says. Like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[['MR. BERGERON',\" Yes. That's essentially the same thing\"],[ 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR',' So how do you deal with Chambers?']]`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a list of lists --it could also be a list of dictionaries if you want it to be. The real programmatic challenge here is to clean up the text files and parse them successfully. Most of the instructions below are devoted to this, but Steps 1 and 2 are also extremely important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go step-by-step through this, and email me whenever you get stuck, and I will help. If you complete all the steps before Tuesday, email me if you want to go further.\n",

Apple, Incorporated. 6 Ms. Sullivan. 7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 10 please the Court: 11 A smartphone is smart because it contains 12 hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it 13 work. But the Federal Circuit held that Section 289 of 14 the Patent Act entitles the holder of a single design 15 patent on a portion of the appearance of the phone to 16 total profit on the entire phone. 17 That result makes no sense. A single design 18 patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone 19 should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the 20 profit on the entire phone. 21 Section 289 does not require that result, 22 and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing, 23 Apple and the government now agree that Section 289 does 24 not require that result. We respectfully ask that the 25 Court hold that when a design patent claims a design\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n4 1 that is applied to a component of a phone or a component 2 of a product, or, to use the language of Section 289, 3 when a design patent is applied to an article of 4 manufacture within a multi-article product, we request 5 that you hold that Section 289 entitles the 6 patent-holder to total profit on the article of 7 manufacture to which the design patent is applied, and 8 not the profits on the total product. 9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem is, is how to 10 instruct the jury on that point. Both parties, not the 11 government, both parties kind of leave it up and say, 12 oh, give it to the juror. If I were the juror, I simply 13 wouldn\\'t know what to do under your -- under your test. 14 My preference, if -- if I were just making 15 another sensible rule, is we\\'d have market studies to 16 see how the -- the extent to which the design affected 17 the consumer, and then the jury would have something to 18 do that. But that\\'s apportionment, which runs headlong 19 into the statute. 20 You can\\'t really have apportionment, so it 21 seems to me you leave us with no -- one choice is to 22 have a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder example 23 that\\'s in the car -- maybe the boat windshield, which is 24 a little more difficult -- and just follow the -- and 25 just follow the words of the statute. But it seems to\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 me neither side gives us an instruction to work with.\\n\\n5\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\n\\n3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: One -- I mean, it\\'s one\\n\\n4 thing to leave it to the jury. It\\'s the other thing --\\n\\n5 if I were the juror, I wouldn\\'t know what to do under\\n\\n6 your brief.\\n\\n7 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we do not propose\\n\\n8 a test that simply leaves it to the jury without\\n\\n9 guidance. The instruction we proposed and that was\\n\\n10 rejected by the district court appears in the blue brief\\n\\n11 at page 21, and what we would have told the jury is that\\n\\n12 the article of manufacture to which a design has been\\n\\n13 applied is the part or portion of the product as sold\\n\\n14 that incorporates or embodies the subject matter of the\\n\\n15 patent.\\n\\n16 So, Justice Kennedy, our test is very\\n\\n17 simple.\\n\\n18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I\\'m the juror, I just\\n\\n19 don\\'t know what to do. I\\'d have the iPhone in the jury\\n\\n20 room; I\\'d -- I\\'d look at it. I just wouldn\\'t know.\\n\\n21 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, what we\\n\\n22 respectfully suggest is that there are two parts to the\\n\\n23 test for what constitutes an article of manufacture.\\n\\n24 And to be clear, I\\'m now stressing our\\n\\n25 article-of-manufacture argument, not the causation\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 argument we gave as an alternative.\\n\\n6\\n\\n2 As the case comes to the Court, all we ask\\n\\n3 is that you rule in favor of us on article of\\n\\n4 manufacture.\\n\\n5 And, Justice Kennedy, the statute tells us\\n\\n6 what to look at --\\n\\n7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I really quickly make\\n\\n8 sure I understand that, that in other words, you\\'re --\\n\\n9 you\\'re saying we should only look to what an article of\\n\\n10 manufacture is and not your other argument that there\\n\\n11 should be apportionment as to any particular article of\\n\\n12 manufacture.\\n\\n13 MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\n\\n14 We\\'re pressing here, as you all you need to resolve the\\n\\n15 case, that a jury should be instructed that total profit\\n\\n16 must be profit derived from the article of manufacture\\n\\n17 to which the design has been applied.\\n\\n18 And, Your Honor, the statute does support\\n\\n19 our test because the statute asks us to look at the\\n\\n20 article of manufacture to which the design has been\\n\\n21 applied.\\n\\n22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is that in\\n\\n23 this -- in this case?\\n\\n24 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, in this case it\\n\\n25 is -- there are three patents. The D\\'677 is on the\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n7 1 front face of a phone. The rectangular, round-cornered 2 front face of a phone. 3 In the D\\'087, it\\'s also the rectangular, 4 round-cornered front face of the phone with certain 5 aspect ratio and corner radii. 6 In the D\\'305, it is the display screen on 7 which the graphical user interface appears. 8 So, to answer Justice Kennedy\\'s question, 9 the jury should have been instructed either with our 10 instruction: Instruction 42.1 would have said to the 11 jury, I\\'m giving you guidance. There\\'s an article of 12 manufacture here, but it may be less than the entire 13 phone. The article of manufacture may be a part or 14 portion of the phone, and you should look at two things, 15 Your Honor. 16 You should look at the patent, and, Justice 17 Kennedy, with respect -- you shouldn\\'t just look at 18 the -- at the phones in the jury room. You ought to 19 look at the patent because, Justice Ginsburg, the patent 20 is going to be the best guide to what the design is 21 applied to in many, many cases, as in this case. 22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Sullivan, you seem 23 to be arguing, as when you opened, that as a matter of 24 law, you were right. And I don\\'t see that as a matter 25 of law.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n8 1 I believe that your basic argument, everyone 2 is in agreement, that the test is an article of 3 manufacture for purposes of sale. 4 But I am like Justice Kennedy, which is, how 5 do we announce the right test for that? Because the 6 phone could be seen by a public -- a purchasing consumer 7 as being just that rounded edge, slim outer shell. That 8 might be what drives the sale. I don\\'t know. 9 Certainly your expert didn\\'t tell me how to 10 figure out the component part. I don\\'t know where in 11 the record you would have enough to survive your 12 argument. 13 MS. SULLIVAN: So, Your Honor, let me back 14 up and restate the test, the burden, and the evidence. 15 The -- the test -- and I want to agree with 16 Your Honor. To be clear, we say that what the Federal 17 Circuit held was wrong as a matter of law. It is wrong 18 as a matter of law to hold that the entire product is 19 necessarily the article of manufacture from which you 20 measure total profit. That\\'s wrong as a matter of law, 21 but we did not argue, Your Honor, that the test has to 22 hold we\\'re right on the article as a matter of law. 23 It\\'s an -- it\\'s a -- it\\'s a question of 24 either fact or, as you said in Markman, a mongrel 25 question of law and fact.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n9 1 And why does it involve both? Because we 2 know that district courts look at patents. You assign 3 them that task in Markman, and we perform it daily. And 4 when they look at a patent for a claim construction, 5 we\\'re asking for part of the test to be very similar. 6 The district court can look at the patent 7 and say, oh, this is Apple\\'s front face patent. This 8 isn\\'t one of Apple\\'s 13 other patents on other parts of 9 the phone, or Apple\\'s other patent on the design of the 10 entire case. This is the front face patent. 11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do -- how would 12 you determine the profit attributable to the relevant 13 article of manufacture? 14 MS. SULLIVAN: Three ways, Your Honor. 15 First, through ordinary accounting that 16 would look to the cost of goods sold in relation to 17 revenues for the relevant component. 18 You could look, if -- if a company buys the 19 component from an original equipment manufacturer, you 20 would look to their profit margins and apply that. 21 If, as sometimes happens within a company, 22 one division makes the glass front face and another 23 division makes the innards of the phone, you would find 24 out the transfer pricing between the divisions. 25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we find out the -- the\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n10 1 production cost if -- if a billion dollars were spent on 2 the inner parts and a hundred million was spent on the 3 face, then it\\'s a 10:1 ratio. 4 MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s absolutely right, Your 5 Honor. Apple didn\\'t -6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you\\'d have expert 7 testimony on all of that. 8 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor, you would. 9 And you would -- but that\\'s just one way. 10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose you had 11 a case where it\\'s a stroke of genius, the design. In -12 in two days, they come up with a design -- let\\'s -13 let\\'s assume the Volkswagen Beetle analogy that some of 14 the briefs refer to. Suppose the Volkswagen Beetle 15 design was done in three days, and it was a stroke of 16 genius and it identified the car. Then it seems to me 17 that that\\'s quite unfair to say, well, we give three 18 days\\' profit, but then it took 100,000 hours to develop 19 the motor. 20 MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, here\\'s what 21 we would do with the Beetle. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that\\'s what -- it 23 seems to me that that\\'s what you would be arguing. 24 MS. SULLIVAN: It\\'s not, Your Honor. To 25 answer Justice Ginsburg\\'s question, there are three ways\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n11 1 Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove the 2 total profit from the relevant article of manufactures 3 here, the front face, or the display screen. One could 4 have been accounting. One could have been consumer 5 demand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested. 6 Apple could have said well, people really like the front 7 face disproportionately to all the other parts of the 8 phone, so they could have used consumer survey evidence 9 to prove that. But -- and so accounting evidence or 10 indirect evidence through consumer survey. But, Your 11 Honor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the total 12 profit from the article of manufacture may sometimes be 13 a substantial part of the total profit on the product. 14 Let\\'s take the Beetle, or let\\'s take a cool, 15 shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette. 16 It may be that the article of manufacture to which the 17 design patent is applied is just the exterior body of 18 the car, but it may be that nobody really wants to pay 19 much for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle. 20 They want to pay for the cool way it looks. 21 If that\\'s so, it should be open to the 22 patent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits come 23 from the exterior of the car. 24 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any difference in 25 practical terms between that and your causation argument\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 or apportionment?\\n\\n12\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Alito.\\n\\n3 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference?\\n\\n4 MS. SULLIVAN: The difference is we concede\\n\\n5 under article of manufacture that the holder of the\\n\\n6 patent gets profit from the article, even if the profit\\n\\n7 does not come entirely from the design.\\n\\n8 Let me give you an example with a phone\\'s\\n\\n9 front face. Consumers may value the front face because\\n\\n10 it\\'s scratch-resistant, because it\\'s water-resistant,\\n\\n11 because it\\'s shatterproof. We\\'re going to give the\\n\\n12 patent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test all\\n\\n13 the profits for the front face, even if it includes\\n\\n14 profit from those non-design features of the front face,\\n\\n15 where the pure apportionment test or pure causation test\\n\\n16 would limit the profits to the profits from the design\\n\\n17 parts rather than the functional parts. So, Your Honor,\\n\\n18 that\\'s a little bit overinclusive. We\\'re getting a\\n\\n19 little more with article of manufacture than we do with\\n\\n20 a pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happy\\n\\n21 for that.\\n\\n22 But the reason we think it\\'s consistent with\\n\\n23 Congress\\'s purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congress\\n\\n24 was trying to do was provide a rule that gives\\n\\n25 design-patent holders total profit from the article of\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 manufacture.\\n\\n13\\n\\n2 That\\'s a little bit overinclusive, because\\n\\n3 if you get total profit on the rugs that were at issue\\n\\n4 in the Dobson cases, you\\'ll get a little profit from the\\n\\n5 design, and there will be a little extra you\\'re getting\\n\\n6 perhaps from the fiber or the weave. We think Congress\\n\\n7 was entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to say\\n\\n8 that it is appropriate as a matter of causation to say\\n\\n9 that design causes value in a single article product\\n\\n10 like a rug.\\n\\n11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I look at this\\n\\n12 record, and they were claiming the profits on the whole\\n\\n13 phone. If you read the Federal Circuit\\'s decision, they\\n\\n14 were saying people buy -- bought this product mostly --\\n\\n15 this was their argument to the jury and it sold the\\n\\n16 Federal Circuit -- because of the look of this phone,\\n\\n17 that, you know, all smartphones basically function the\\n\\n18 same. People don\\'t really put much value on the unit.\\n\\n19 This is what they were arguing, and they put on an\\n\\n20 expert that gave total profits. If the jury credited\\n\\n21 them, could you -- and you were properly -- it was a\\n\\n22 properly instructed jury, could you overturn that\\n\\n23 finding?\\n\\n24 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let\\'s go back to\\n\\n25 the proper instruction. The jury was not properly\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 instructed here.\\n\\n14\\n\\n2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I accept that,\\n\\n3 Miss Sullivan. I\\'m asking you --\\n\\n4 MS. SULLIVAN: Two answers, Your Honor. If\\n\\n5 the article of manufacture was the entire ornamental\\n\\n6 appearance of the phone and Apple does have a patent on\\n\\n7 the entire outside of the phone, why didn\\'t they assert\\n\\n8 it here? Because the entire outside of a Samsung phone\\n\\n9 does not look substantially similar to the entire\\n\\n10 outside of a Samsung phone. The reason why design\\n\\n11 patencies carve the product up into multiple partial\\n\\n12 design claims is so they can make a narrow infringement\\n\\n13 argument and find a little sliver of the phone on which\\n\\n14 infringement can be found, and it\\'s inappropriate to\\n\\n15 give total profit when they do that.\\n\\n16 So, Your Honor, if there had been a design\\n\\n17 patent on the entire case, then, yes, absolutely, Apple\\n\\n18 could have tried to get total profit on the entire case.\\n\\n19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you\\'re answering\\n\\n20 \"no\" to my question. You\\'re saying a properly\\n\\n21 instructed jury on the evidence presented in this case\\n\\n22 could not have found for Apple. Is that what --\\n\\n23 MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\\n\\n24 That is very much our position.\\n\\n25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So besides the jury\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 instruction, what was the legal error?\\n\\n15\\n\\n2 MS. SULLIVAN: The legal error was in the\\n\\n3 jury instruction --\\n\\n4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I said besides a\\n\\n5 properly instructed jury, could they have found in favor\\n\\n6 of Apple on the evidence presented?\\n\\n7 MS. SULLIVAN: They could not, Your Honor,\\n\\n8 because --\\n\\n9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what, besides the\\n\\n10 jury instruction -- \\'cause I\\'m assuming that a proper\\n\\n11 instruction was given -- what would have been the legal\\n\\n12 error?\\n\\n13 MS. SULLIVAN: There would have been -- no\\n\\n14 reasonable jury could have found on this record that the\\n\\n15 entire product was the article of manufacture to which\\n\\n16 the design has been applied. Two reasons.\\n\\n17 One, design patents cover ornamental\\n\\n18 appearance. They cannot, by definition, cover the\\n\\n19 innards of the phone. So the functional innards of the\\n\\n20 phone cannot be part of what is claimed by the design\\n\\n21 patent.\\n\\n22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you can\\'t claim\\n\\n23 the design patent for a Volkswagen doesn\\'t cover the\\n\\n24 innards, but you just admitted that a jury could find\\n\\n25 its -- could find that the consumers and others would\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n16 1 perceive the Volkswagen to be a Volkswagen by its looks 2 only. 3 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, we\\'re talking 4 about design patents, not trademark or copyright. 5 There\\'s no requirement of consumer confusion here on 6 the -7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don\\'t disagree with 8 you, but -9 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let me answer 10 your question as precisely as I can. Just because you 11 can show that most of the profit comes from the Beetle 12 exterior does not mean the car is the article of 13 manufacture. There\\'s two steps here in our test. 14 First, determine what is the article of 15 manufacture. 16 Then second step, determine the quantum of 17 damages, quantum of profits in this case, from that 18 article. 19 Under your hypo, what -- if Apple got almost 20 all its profits from the exterior case, people were 21 indifferent to whether they could read their e-mail, 22 navigate, take photos, or any other functions. If you 23 could prove that it\\'s a counterfactual that couldn\\'t 24 happen, but if you could prove that, as in the Corvette 25 or the Beetle hypo, then the total profit from the\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n17 1 article of manufacture could be a substantial portion of 2 the total product and the profit. That\\'s not this case. 3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did Samsung, at the 4 trial, propose basing damages on profits from an article 5 less than the whole phone? 6 MS. SULLIVAN: Six times, Your Honor. And 7 we were rebuffed every time. At the -- in the jury 8 instruction -- sorry. At the -- before the trial began, 9 we submitted a legal brief. It\\'s Docket 1322. We said 10 very clearly article of manufacture is less than the 11 total phone and profit should be limited to the profit 12 from the article. We said again in the jury 13 instructions -- and here I would refer you respectfully 14 to joint Appendix 206, 207 and to the result of that on 15 petition Appendix 165A. What happened is we went to the 16 court and we said please listen to us about article of 17 manufacture, if you only get the total profit on the 18 article. The district court said, no, I already said no 19 apportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said no 20 apportionment, she shut us out of both theories. The 21 district court shut us out of article of manufacture as 22 the basis for total profit, and it shut us out of 23 causation or apportionment, which we don\\'t press here. 24 So that\\'s twice. Our legal brief, our 25 charge conference. And then again in our 50A and the\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n18 1 key rulings on 50A at the close of evidence, we again 2 said article is separate from apportionment, and the 3 article here is less than the phone. At 197 we said 4 at -- sorry. At JA197 we again said article is less 5 than the phone. And in the 50B at the close of the 6 first trial, we again said article is less than the 7 phone. 8 Second trial happens on certain phones. 9 Again, in the 50A and the 50B, the trial court says 10 again, I have ruled that there\\'s no apportionment for 11 design patents. You cannot talk to me about article of 12 manufacture. We tried over and over and over again to 13 get the article of manufacture\\'s theory embraced, and we 14 were rejected. And why does that matter, Your Honor? 15 Because there was evidence in the case from which a 16 reasonable, properly instructed jury could have found 17 that the components were the front face, the front face, 18 and the display screen. And the evidence came out of 19 Apple\\'s own witnesses, which we\\'re certainly entitled to 20 rely on. Your Honor, Apple\\'s own witnesses again and 21 again said what are you claiming. And when the 22 witnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn\\'t 23 say the whole phone, the look and feel. They said we\\'re 24 claiming a very specific front face, and by the way, 25 ignore the home button. We\\'re claiming a very specific\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n19 1 front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignore 2 everything that\\'s outside the dotted lines. 3 And if I could just remind you that we\\'ve 4 reprinted the patents for you to see, and they may look 5 like an iPhone on page 7, which is the D\\'677. They may 6 look like an iPhone in the D\\'087, which was in 7 Blueberry, set 8, but the claim is not for the iPhone. 8 The claim is for the small portion of the external 9 appearance of the phone that is inside the solid line. 10 Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line. It 11 disclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines. 12 And Your Honor, the question for the jury 13 was not did people think that the look and feel of an 14 iPhone was great. The question for the jury was did the 15 very small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makes 16 look substantially similar to the very small portion of 17 the patent claim? 18 Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis in 19 this record for a conclusion that the entire product, 20 profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profit 21 from those articles. What Apple should have done is 22 done either of the two things we discussed earlier, 23 accounting evidence about revenues minus cost of goods 24 sold on the components, or it should have done consumer 25 survey evidence like our expert did.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n20 1 JUSTICE ALITO: The Solicitor General has 2 proposed a test with four factors to determine the 3 article question. Do you agree with those? Are there 4 others you would add? 5 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, I\\'ll answer 6 briefly, and then I\\'d like to reserve my time. 7 We -- we like the Solicitor General\\'s test. 8 We propose a briefer test that we think is more 9 administrable. We propose that you look to two factors: 10 The design in the patent and the accused product. We 11 think our test is more administrable, and it can often 12 be done, Justice Kennedy, by judges as they do in 13 Markman, who will then instruct the jury and give them 14 guidance. And I\\'ll be happy to explain further on 15 rebuttal. Thank you very much. 16 I\\'d like to reserve the balance of my time, 17 Mr. Chief Justice. 18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 19 Mr. Fletcher. 20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER 21 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 22 SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY 23 MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 24 and may it please the Court: 25 This case presents two related questions\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 about the scope of the remedy that\\'s available for\\n\\n21\\n\\n2 design-patent infringement under Section 289. If I\\n\\n3 understood my friend Ms. Sullivan\\'s presentation\\n\\n4 correctly, the parties are now in agreement about both\\n\\n5 of those legal questions.\\n\\n6 Just to summarize briefly, first, the court\\n\\n7 of appeals correctly held that Section 289\\'s provision\\n\\n8 for an award of total profits means that the\\n\\n9 patent-holder can recover all of the profits from the\\n\\n10 sale of the infringing articles and manufacture and not\\n\\n11 just the portion of the profits that the patent-holder\\n\\n12 can prove was caused by or attributable to the design as\\n\\n13 opposed to other features of the article.\\n\\n14 But second, we read the court of appeals\\'\\n\\n15 opinion to have held that the relevant article of\\n\\n16 manufacture for which profits are owed is always the\\n\\n17 entire product that the infringer sells to customers.\\n\\n18 And we think that\\'s a mistake, and we understand all\\n\\n19 parties to agree with that now.\\n\\n20 Instead, the relevant article of manufacture\\n\\n21 to which a patented design may be applied will sometimes\\n\\n22 be a part or a component of a larger product sold in\\n\\n23 commerce. And when that is the case, all parties now\\n\\n24 agree that the patent-holder is entitled only to the\\n\\n25 profits from that infringing article and not to all --\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n22 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the -- when the 2 component -- when the article of manufacture isn\\'t sold 3 apart from the entire product, how should the -- the 4 judge charge the jury on determining the profit 5 attributable to the infringing article? 6 MR. FLETCHER: So we think that there\\'d be 7 two factual questions in a case where that\\'s disputed. 8 The first one would be what is the relevant article, and 9 there may be a dispute on that as there is in this case. 10 The second question, once the fact-finder 11 identifies the relevant article, is the question that 12 you asked, which is how much of the total profits from 13 the device are attributable to the infringing article? 14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What\\'s the first step, 15 and how do you figure it out? 16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May he -- may he complete 17 his answer to my question? 18 MR. FLETCHER: So Justice Ginsburg, on the 19 second step, we urge the Court not to speak to that in a 20 lot of detail because it hasn\\'t been briefed in this 21 case. This case sort of stopped at the first step. But 22 we think that courts could sensibly look to the way that 23 courts have handled other analogous questions, and I 24 point to two areas of law where that\\'s happened. 25 The first is utility patent damages under\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n23 1 the Patent Act, before 1946, permitted an award of the 2 infringer\\'s profits. And in those cases, very often a 3 patent would apply to part of a larger product sold in 4 commerce, and the fact-finder would say you\\'re entitled 5 to the profits that are attributable to the infringing 6 part, but not the whole machine. 7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is Justice -- Justice 8 Ginsburg\\'s question. Is that -- is your answer to her, 9 adequately summarized, the test that you propose at 10 page 9 of your brief relevant considerations include? 11 MR. FLETCHER: So I think the test we 12 propose at page 9 goes to the first of the two questions 13 that I was speaking to, which is what\\'s the article of 14 manufacture to which the design has been applied? Once 15 the fact-finder makes that judgment, that\\'s the test 16 that we proposed, and that\\'s, I think, I took to be 17 Justice Sotomayor\\'s question. 18 I understood Justice Ginsburg to be asking 19 once the fact-finder decides that the relevant article 20 is, say, the windshield on the boat or the cup-holder on 21 the car, how do they separate out the part of the 22 profits that are attributable to that component from the 23 whole. 24 And as to that question, we haven\\'t briefed 25 it in a lot of detail, but I was trying to explain to\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n24 1 Justice Ginsburg that there are analogous problems that 2 courts have confronted in other areas of law. One was 3 utility patent damages, as I described. Another one is 4 discussed at some length in this Court\\'s decision in the 5 Sheldon case under the Copyright Act. That was a case 6 where the copyright was on a script -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would expert witnesses be 8 called on in order to show part one or part two or both? 9 MR. FLETCHER: I -- I would think very often 10 both. 11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would those 12 expert witnesses -- who would they be? What would they 13 say? 14 MR. FLETCHER: So I think it will depend 15 on -- on the circumstances of the case. 16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case. 17 MR. FLETCHER: In this case, I think someone 18 familiar with the industry, someone who had worked in 19 the industry, either at -- a manufacture of a smartphone 20 company, or someone who is familiar with the market for 21 smartphones and who could speak to on the first question 22 how smartphones are put together, how they are 23 manufactured, how they\\'re used by the users, the extent 24 to which the components of a smartphone are separable. 25 And then on the second question, the one\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n25 1 that Justice Ginsburg was asking, I think they would -2 the experts would probably be speaking -- or could be 3 speaking to some of the issues that Your Honor raised in 4 your question in the Sullivan, which is things like 5 consumer surveys, to what extent do the various 6 components of a smartphone drive consumer demand and 7 contribute to the value of the phone. 8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of the 9 things that was mentioned was cost in terms of that. I 10 don\\'t understand how that helps on this question. It 11 would seem to me the higher the cost, the less it 12 contributed to profits. 13 MR. FLETCHER: So I think, Mr. Chief 14 Justice, it will depend on the case. Sometimes you -15 you might try to build up the share of the profits from 16 the bottom up by saying, what\\'s the cost of each of 17 these components, and then what share of the revenue is 18 attributable to each of these components. And then you 19 say this component is 10 percent of the cost and 20 20 percent of the revenue, and we -- we do a bottom-up 21 calculation and try to do it that way. 22 Courts haven\\'t always done that. Sometimes 23 that won\\'t be feasible. Sometimes instead they\\'ve -24 they\\'ve done a more impressionistic approximation and 25 said the total profits on this product are $10 million,\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n26 1 and we think that the component at issue here, based on 2 expert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or 3 25 percent. 4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you said based 5 on expert testimony. What would -- what would they be 6 talking about? 7 MR. FLETCHER: So I think the -- the Sheldon 8 case that\\'s cited on page 27 of our brief from this 9 Court that was a Copyright Act case but discussed these 10 problems sort of generally discussed how you apportion 11 the portion -- the profits from a movie that are 12 attributable to the script as opposed to the actors or 13 the directors or other things. And they had experts who 14 were familiar with the industry and who said the script 15 is important but, really, a lot of the value and 16 particularly for a movie like this comes from other 17 things. 18 And there were various expert testimonies 19 that gave varying percentages, and the Court ended up 20 saying that the court below had awarded 20 percent of 21 the total profits from the movie, and this Court 22 affirmed that award and said that\\'s a reasonable 23 approximation. 24 We\\'re not -- never going to be able to get 25 to certainty, but on these sorts of profits questions\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 and these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable\\n\\n27\\n\\n2 approximation is good enough, and it\\'s certainly better\\n\\n3 than awarding all or nothing. And courts have been able\\n\\n4 to come to those reasonable approximations by using\\n\\n5 expert testimony in some of the ways that we\\'ve\\n\\n6 discussed.\\n\\n7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fletcher, could you\\n\\n8 speak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as I\\n\\n9 understand Ms. Sullivan\\'s answer, she said, well, that\\n\\n10 distinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it\\'s\\n\\n11 just -- it\\'s still -- the article is only the body of\\n\\n12 the car. And -- and you say, no, there\\'s a real\\n\\n13 question as to whether it is being -- the design is\\n\\n14 being applied to the car itself.\\n\\n15 So how would you go about thinking about\\n\\n16 that question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, and\\n\\n17 under what instructions?\\n\\n18 MR. FLETCHER: So we think the basic\\n\\n19 question for the fact-finders, what\\'s the article of\\n\\n20 manufacture to which the design has been applied. We\\n\\n21 think the fact-finder should bear in mind this Court\\'s\\n\\n22 observation in Gorham. It\\'s 1871, first design patent\\n\\n23 case that the -- what a design is, is it\\'s the thing\\n\\n24 that gives the distinctive appearance to an article of\\n\\n25 manufacture.\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n28 1 And the point we\\'re making with the VW Bug 2 example is that in some cases, that\\'s going to be very 3 easy. If the patented design is for a refrigerator 4 latch, no one is going to think that the latch gives the 5 distinctive appearance to the entire refrigerator. 6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But let\\'s talk about 7 the hard cases. 8 MR. FLETCHER: Right. So the hard cases, 9 like the Bug, one can reasonably say that it\\'s either 10 the body or the car. Then we\\'ve given the Court four 11 factors, and we think the fact-finder or a jury, if the 12 jury is the fact-finder, ought to be instructed on those 13 factors. And so we say you should compare the scope of 14 the patented design as shown in the drawings in the 15 patent, how prominently that design features in the 16 accused article, whether there are other conceptually 17 distinct innovations or components in the article that 18 are not part of or associated with the patented design, 19 and finally the physical relationship between the 20 patented design and the rest of the article. 21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were a juror, how 22 would you decide the Beetle case, or what experts would 23 you want to hear? 24 MR. FLETCHER: I would want to hear as -- as 25 to the article, what\\'s the article --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n29 1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Shouldn\\'t have given you 2 that second option. 3 MR. FLETCHER: I -- I do think it\\'s a 4 factual question. I do think you\\'d want to hear from 5 experts who can speak to the question of how is the 6 Beetle put together, and what other parts of the -- the 7 Beetle -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the Beetle 9 put together? It\\'s put together like every other car. 10 I mean, I don\\'t see how that\\'s going to tell you whether 11 the shape of the body is distinctive or not. 12 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think you\\'d also want 13 to know, to put it in terms of all four factors, that 14 the scope of the claim design covers the whole article, 15 but not the interior of the car. There are design 16 features in the interior that the driver sees that 17 aren\\'t the body of the article. 18 As to the second factor, how prominent is 19 the design feature, I think that\\'s one that cuts in 20 favor of finding that the design does cover the whole 21 article. 22 Then the third one is conceptually distinct 23 innovations, and I think that one cuts the other way. 24 There are going to be lots of other features of the car 25 or innovations in the car -- the engine, the steering\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 system, things like that -- that\\'s an area where you\\n\\n30\\n\\n2 might want to hear adverse testimony.\\n\\n3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that\\'s the first\\n\\n4 part of the test.\\n\\n5 MR. FLETCHER: Correct.\\n\\n6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That\\'s the article of\\n\\n7 manufacture.\\n\\n8 So now take the second part of the test and\\n\\n9 apply it to the Bug.\\n\\n10 MR. FLETCHER: So supposing that we\\'ve\\n\\n11 decided that the Bug -- the relevant article in the Bug\\n\\n12 is just the body of the Bug.\\n\\n13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\\n\\n14 MR. FLETCHER: Then I think the question is\\n\\n15 the best way to determine that, at least that I can\\n\\n16 think of right now, would be consumer surveys addressed\\n\\n17 to, to what extent are people who buy Bugs making their\\n\\n18 purchasing decisions based on the look of the car, and\\n\\n19 to what extent are they instead valuing other things\\n\\n20 like --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think that that\\n\\n22 question is not relevant to the first question. In\\n\\n23 other words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugs\\n\\n24 buy them because of the look of the car.\\n\\n25 MR. FLETCHER: Yes.\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n31 1 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you think that that\\'s 2 only relevant at question 2 rather than at question 1, 3 which is the question of whether it\\'s the body or the 4 whole car that the design is being applied to? 5 MR. FLETCHER: I do. I think that\\'s the 6 statute -- the way the statute reads. It says you get 7 profits from the article of manufacture. And so, 8 logically, I think the way to approach it would be 9 identify the article and then let the patent-holder make 10 the argument that even though the article may be just a 11 part of the product sold -- and here, maybe it\\'s just 12 the case of the front face -- really, that\\'s what sells 13 it. And so that that test still lets the patent-holder, 14 in a case where it is the design of the article that\\'s 15 selling the whole product, still recover a very 16 substantial portion of the profits -17 JUSTICE ALITO: But this hypothetical is -18 MR. FLETCHER: -- in a different way. 19 JUSTICE ALITO: This hypothetical is not 20 helpful to me, because I can\\'t get over the thought that 21 nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like 22 the way it looks. What if it, you know, costs, I think, 23 $1800 when it was first sold in the United States? What 24 if it cost $18,000? What if it got 2 miles per gallon? 25 What if it broke down every 50 miles?\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n32 1 So if that is a real question, if it is a 2 real question whether the article of manufacture there 3 is the design or the entire car, gives me pause about 4 the test for determining what is the article of 5 manufacture. 6 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think that those 7 things can be taken into account at the second step of 8 the test, if you decide that the relevant design -- the 9 relevant article of manufacture is the body of the car, 10 but for all of the reasons you just pointed out. 11 JUSTICE ALITO: No. But what if you -- you 12 were saying it\\'s an open -- it would be a difficult 13 question. You\\'d have to apply numerous factors to 14 determine what is the article of manufacture there. 15 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I -- then I think if 16 you\\'re skeptical about that, I think our test for 17 article of manufacture also lets some of those 18 considerations play into that test, because it gets to 19 whether there are other conceptually distinct invasions, 20 or other components of the product unrelated to the 21 design. 22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 23 MR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Chief Justice. 24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman. 25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n33 1 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 2 and may it please the Court: 3 Before I address the Court\\'s many questions 4 initiated by Justice Kennedy about what should the jury 5 be instructed under what we and the government believe 6 to be the relevant question -- that is, the factual test 7 of whether the relevant article of manufacture is the 8 article as sold or a distinct component of it -- and I 9 think it\\'s very clear to address the questions that 10 Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor asked, and 11 Ms. Sullivan\\'s response to what actually happened in 12 this case. 13 There is no -- whatever you determine the 14 right instruction should be, there is no basis to 15 overturn the jury\\'s damages verdict in this case. 16 There were two trials below. In neither 17 trial did Samsung, either in argument, statement, or 18 witness testimony, ever identify for the jury any 19 article of manufacture other than the phones themselves. 20 In both trials, Samsung\\'s expert witness, Mr. Wagner, 21 calculated total profits under 289 only on the phones 22 themselves. And thus there is no -- no reasonable juror 23 in these trials could possibly have awarded total 24 profits on anything other than the phones, unless this 25 Court holds --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n34 1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because the 2 district judge limited them? 3 MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not. What happened 4 was, we put in our initial papers saying -- there\\'s a 5 pretrial statement that the parties have to file saying, 6 these are -- the phones are the -- the phones were 7 infringed. The phones are the things that were 8 infringed for purposes of sale, and here is what our 9 evidence is on total profits from the phone. 10 JUSTICE BREYER: So disagreement on this 11 point. So why, if -- we have a hard-enough question 12 trying to figure out what the standard is. Now, why 13 can\\'t we just ask the lower courts to listen to your 14 arguments and theirs, and work it out? 15 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, this is not a 16 difficult -- the record in this case is not difficult. 17 JUSTICE BREYER: You don\\'t think it\\'s 18 difficult, but they think -19 MR. WAXMAN: Well -20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- they think it\\'s 21 difficult. In fact, they think it\\'s easy on their side. 22 So if I go through and come to the 23 conclusion, at least, that each side has a good 24 argument, under those circumstances, why don\\'t we focus 25 on the question that is of great importance across\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n35 1 industries and leave the application of that and whether 2 it was properly raised to the lower courts? 3 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, if this were 4 difficult, it would be entirely appropriate for this 5 Court simply to announce what the law is, which I think 6 there is a great need for this Court to do. And we\\'re 7 not suggesting that it wouldn\\'t -- that it isn\\'t 8 necessary for the Court to do it. 9 This is a case very much like global tech, 10 when you found that the lower court had applied the 11 wrong standard for intentional infringement, and then 12 found that the record -- even -- but under the correct 13 higher standard, the record admitted no other 14 conclusion. What\\'s so easy about this case is that they 15 never identified to the jury, in either case, any 16 article of manufacture other than the phone. And all of 17 their evidence, Justice Breyer, was calculated based on 18 the total profits to the phone. 19 JUSTICE BREYER: I get your point. I\\'ll 20 read it and I\\'ll -21 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you. 22 JUSTICE BREYER: But I have a question on 23 the general issue, which I think is tough. And the 24 general question that I have is I have been looking for 25 a standard. Now, one of the standards -- which are all\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n36 1 quite close; the parties actually in the government are 2 fairly close on this -- but is in a brief for the 3 Internet Association, the software industry. And you 4 know that brief I\\'m talking about on Facebook and some 5 others. 6 MR. WAXMAN: I do. 7 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What they did is 8 they went back into history. They have a lot of 9 different cases which they base the standard on, and 10 they come to the conclusion, which is a little vague, 11 but that the design where it\\'s been applied to only 12 part -- it\\'s on page 23 -- of a multicomponent product 13 and does not drive demand for the entire product, the 14 article of manufacture is rightly considered to be only 15 the component to which the design applies. And only 16 profit attributable to that component may be awarded. 17 Now, really, to understand it, you have to 18 have examples -- but antitrust cases are hard to 19 understand -- and our rule of reason and people do use 20 examples. And so that kind of standard, with perhaps 21 examples to explain it to the jury, you know, wallpaper, 22 you get the whole thing. A Rolls Royce thing on the 23 hood? No, no, no. You don\\'t get all the profit from 24 the car. 25 MR. WAXMAN: Justice --\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n37 1 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, why not? 2 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I -- I understand your 3 question, and I just want to bookmark the fact that I 4 have not yet had a chance to answer Justice Ginsburg\\'s 5 question. 6 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Then go ahead and 7 answer her question. At some point you can come back to 8 it. 9 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I\\'ll answer Justice 10 Ginsburg first and then Justice Breyer. 11 Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that 12 Samsung was precluded from doing -- and this happened in 13 the Daubert ruling with respect to their expert report, 14 Mr. Wagner\\'s report -- was they -- he was not allowed to 15 present evidence about that -- about the value of design 16 to the total product as a whole. That was 17 apportionment, Judge Koh said. 18 He wanted -- he calculated total profits 19 based on the phone. And his report then said, well, but 20 I believe that only 1 percent of the value of the phone 21 is due to the design or the design of the iconic front 22 face of the phone. And that, she wouldn\\'t allow him to 23 do because that was apportionment. 24 The question -- the only issue with respect 25 to article of manufacture that Samsung ever made in\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n38 1 either trial or in the Court of Appeals was that, as a 2 matter of law in a multicomponent product, the article 3 of manufacture must be the portion. 4 They never said that to the jury. They did 5 propose a jury instruction, 42.1, which directed the 6 jury that that\\'s what it was supposed to do. It also 7 directed the jury to apportion, and the judge didn\\'t 8 approve it. Now, it just so happens that they preserved 9 no relevant objection to -10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, we\\'re 11 spending an awful lot of time on an issue about what was 12 raised below, what wasn\\'t raised below, what was raised 13 below, what wasn\\'t raised. Maybe it\\'s a good time to 14 turn to Justice Breyer\\'s question. 15 MR. WAXMAN: I would be very happy to do 16 that. 17 Justice Breyer, the -- there is no question 18 that in an appropriate case the jury can decide whether 19 the article of manufacture to which the design is 20 applied and to which it provides a distinctive and 21 pleasing appearance could either be the article that\\'s 22 actually sold to consumers, that\\'s bought by consumers, 23 or it could be a component of it. 24 In the case of a wall hanging, there\\'s 25 really not much dispute. In the case of the cup-holder,\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n39 1 there really isn\\'t much dispute. It is a question of 2 fact for the jury. 3 We believe that the -- the four factors that 4 the Solicitor General articulated would be appropriate 5 factors to consider. 6 I think that a -- in a case in which -7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is the 8 question of fact? 9 MR. WAXMAN: Here\\'s -10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The article to -- to which 11 the law applies? What -- what is the question of fact? 12 MR. WAXMAN: Here is what I would say. In a 13 case in which the jury heard evidence as to competing 14 articles of manufacture, as to what total profits should 15 be applied to, the jury would be told, if you find 16 infringement, total profits are awarded on the article 17 of manufacture to which the patented design was applied 18 for the purpose of sale and to which it gives peculiar 19 or distinctive appearance. 20 You may determine that the article of 21 manufacture is the entire product or a distinct 22 component of that product. In making that 23 determination, you may consider, and this would depend 24 on the evidence in the case, among other factors I would 25 include the Solicitor General\\'s, and there may be other\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n40 1 things. For example, most importantly the identity of 2 what it is that is typically consumed by purchasers. 3 Whether the patented design is likely to cause consumers 4 to purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 5 patentee\\'s product. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- maybe I\\'m not 7 grasping the difficulties in the case. It seems to me 8 that the design is applied to the exterior case of the 9 phone. It\\'s not applied to the -- all the chips and 10 wires, so why -11 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s right. 12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -13 MR. WAXMAN: That\\'s absolutely right. And, 14 you know, of course you can\\'t get a design patent on 15 something that the consumer can\\'t see. And yet 16 Congress -17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there should -18 there shouldn\\'t be profits awarded based on the entire 19 price of the phone. 20 MR. WAXMAN: No. The profits are awarded on 21 the article of manufacture to which the design is 22 applied. 23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The outside, the 24 case is part of it. 25 MR. WAXMAN: Well, maybe and maybe not. I\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n41 1 think the -- the difficulty here is that it\\'s important 2 to understand that design is not a component and the 3 patented design is not the article of manufacture. The 4 patented design is something that\\'s applied to an 5 article of manufacture. 6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, 7 these -- these little, the chips and all are articles of 8 manufacture, right? How is the design of the case 9 applied to those chips? 10 MR. WAXMAN: The same way that -- I mean, if 11 you look at, for example, in the early days, when the 12 patent -- when the design -- when design patents were 13 first permitted by statute in 1842, the first hundred -14 of the first hundred patents that were issued, 55 of 15 them were for stoves and furnaces and steam engines and 16 things like that. Congress -- when Congress said that 17 you are entitled, you know, in response to the Dobson 18 cases, that as an alternative remedy, if there is 19 infringement of a design -- which, by the way, does not 20 happen innocently. 21 When there is infringement of a design, the 22 patentee may choose an alternative remedy which is 23 essentially to have the jury put him or her in the shoes 24 of the infringer. That is, to -- to disgorge the 25 profits from the article to which the design was\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0c1 applied.\\n\\nOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n\\n42\\n\\n2 There\\'s no doubt the steam engine had plenty\\n\\n3 of working components, but a design is not a component.\\n\\n4 A design is applied to a thing. And the jury has to\\n\\n5 decide in the case of the VW Beetle that you have either\\n\\n6 a cup-holder or a patented hubcap, or the iconic shape\\n\\n7 of the car, I think that a jury could very well conclude\\n\\n8 that because someone who sees the iconic shape of a VW\\n\\n9 Beetle and buys it thinks that they are buying the\\n\\n10 Beetle, that is, after all the reason why the infringer\\n\\n11 copied it.\\n\\n12 The -- we know from Samsung\\'s own documents\\n\\n13 in this case, for example, that are recounted in our\\n\\n14 brief, Samsung realized that it faced what this\\n\\n15 executive called a crisis of design. And the crisis of\\n\\n16 design was reflected, the documents show, in the\\n\\n17 telephone company saying, you have to create something\\n\\n18 like the iPhone, and a directive came out to create\\n\\n19 something like the iPhone so we can stop use -- losing\\n\\n20 sales. And in three months --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, can we go\\n\\n22 back to the government\\'s test, because if -- so far your\\n\\n23 test has a lot of steps, but I don\\'t know what it\\'s\\n\\n24 going towards. Okay.\\n\\n25 They suggest two things. Article of\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n43 1 manufacture is the article of manufacture. They have a 2 four-part test. Do you agree that that four-part test 3 with respect to identifying just the article of 4 manufacture? 5 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, with the following caveat 6 only. What -- the factors that the jury will be told 7 will depend on the evidence that the parties educe -8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t go to 9 the -- to the record. 10 MR. WAXMAN: I\\'m not going to the -- I\\'m 11 sticking with the test. 12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That\\'s the 13 test. 14 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. 15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let\\'s assume, because 16 it makes logical sense to me, it may not to anybody 17 else, okay, that the Volkswagen body, not the innards, 18 are the article of manufacture. 19 Now, the government would say, go to the 20 second test, which takes in some of the things that you 21 were talking about, to figure out how much of the 22 profits that VW makes from the Bug are attributable to 23 the shape of the car. 24 Now, as Justice Alito said, some people 25 don\\'t care a wit about the shape of the car. They want\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n44 1 just a small car. They want the car that has a certain 2 trunk. People buy cars for a multitude of reasons. 3 Experts would come in and say, but it\\'s 4 90 percent of the profits. It may be that the body 5 accounts for only 10 percent of the cost of the car, but 6 90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shape 7 of the car. What\\'s wrong with that analysis? 8 That\\'s what I understand the government\\'s 9 analysis to be. That that\\'s what a jury has to be told 10 to do, to decide how much value the design is to the 11 product being sold. That\\'s the government\\'s test in a 12 nutshell. 13 MR. WAXMAN: So -- okay. So this is a test 14 that the government has articulated here at oral 15 argument. It has not been briefed by anybody. 16 The issue of how you calculate total profits 17 on something less than the whole article as sold was 18 wrestled with, I think, best by the Second Circuit in 19 the second Piano case, where in the second Piano case, 20 the Court said, well, okay, the first part of the test, 21 how do you determine what the article of manufacture is, 22 hasn\\'t provided a lot of difficulty. The real 23 difficulty is in calculating a hundred percent of the 24 profits from that article of manufacture. 25 The -- the few courts that have addressed\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 this that I\\'ve seen it have done it in a way that I\\n\\n45\\n\\n2 think probably makes the most sense and is the least\\n\\n3 difficult conceptually which is to say, okay, what were\\n\\n4 the costs of producing that article, that particular\\n\\n5 subcomponent, and what was the company\\'s profit margin\\n\\n6 on the product as a whole applied to that little\\n\\n7 component?\\n\\n8 Now, the difficulty with that -- I mean, I\\n\\n9 think that\\'s what courts have generally done. And what\\n\\n10 it underscores, and in appropriate cases it may be\\n\\n11 appropriate, like the cup-holder example, but what it\\n\\n12 underscores is the very --\\n\\n13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please don\\'t get off\\n\\n14 track.\\n\\n15 MR. WAXMAN: Okay.\\n\\n16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you endorse that part\\n\\n17 of the government\\'s test? How we measure it, you\\'re\\n\\n18 saying, hasn\\'t been briefed adequately. The government\\n\\n19 is saying the same thing. But is -- conceptually, is\\n\\n20 that right?\\n\\n21 MR. WAXMAN: Conceptually, it is correct\\n\\n22 that under Section 289 the patentee is entitled to the\\n\\n23 total profits on the sale of the articles of manufacture\\n\\n24 to which the design has been applied. That is\\n\\n25 relatively straightforward when, in a contested case,\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n46 1 the jury concludes that the article of manufacture is 2 the product that\\'s sold. It is more complicated when 3 the jury concludes that the relevant article of 4 manufacture, as was the case in the piano cases where 5 customers could choose an array of cases in which to put 6 the piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure out 7 total profits from the manufacture and sale of the case. 8 But the decided cases that I have seen have 9 looked at the question what was the manufacture -- what 10 were the direct costs associated with producing the 11 relevant piano cases and what was the profit margin on 12 the piano as applied to that. 13 And may I just add one other point which I 14 think is still on track. The problem with that is that 15 it runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congress 16 was concerned about in 1887 when it passed the Design 17 Patent Act, because the concern was that counterfeiters 18 and copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the only 19 compensation was something that could be viewed as the 20 cost of doing business, that is okay, you\\'re going to 21 get a 10 percent margin on $2.50 for what it cost to 22 produce this little component, there would be no 23 deterrents to what Congress deemed to be an emergency. 24 Yes, Justice Kagan. 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Let\\'s take a case -- and I\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 think that the VW example is a good example for this\\n\\n47\\n\\n2 reason -- where the thing that makes the product\\n\\n3 distinctive does not cost all that much. There\\'s not\\n\\n4 been a lot of input. Somebody just -- some engineer or\\n\\n5 some graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and said\\n\\n6 I just have this great idea for an appearance. But\\n\\n7 that\\'s the principal reason why the product has been\\n\\n8 successful. I mean, the car has to run, and it has to\\n\\n9 do all the other things that cars do, but the principal\\n\\n10 reason why the car has been successful has to do with\\n\\n11 this particular appearance, the design.\\n\\n12 As I understood the government, that does\\n\\n13 not come into the first inquiry. That does not come\\n\\n14 into the question of what is the article. It only comes\\n\\n15 into the second inquiry, which is how much of the\\n\\n16 profits are attributable to that article.\\n\\n17 Do you agree with that?\\n\\n18 MR. WAXMAN: I don\\'t think that that -- I\\n\\n19 don\\'t agree with -- if that is the government\\'s test as\\n\\n20 you have articulated it, I wouldn\\'t agree with that. I\\n\\n21 think that the government\\'s -- if you look at the\\n\\n22 government\\'s factors, you know, one factor is the\\n\\n23 relative prominence of the design within the product as\\n\\n24 a whole. And the government says that whether the\\n\\n25 design -- in other words, whether the design is a\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n48 1 significant attribute of the entire product affecting 2 the appearance of the product as a whole would suggest 3 that the article should be the product. 4 Another factor in the government\\'s test is 5 the physical relationship between the patented design 6 and the rest of the product. In other words, as the 7 government\\'s brief says, can the user or the seller 8 physically separate it, or is it manufactured 9 separately. 10 Another factor is whether the design is 11 conceptually different from the product as a whole, as, 12 for example, a design on a book binding is different 13 from the intellectual property reflected in the 14 copyright material in the book. Those -- we agree with 15 all those factors as relevant, but I do think directly, 16 you know, speaking to the question that you raised, the 17 first factor that I mentioned, the relative prominence 18 of the design within the product of the whole is in 19 essence asking -- and it is a relevant question in 20 determining the article of manufacture -- whether the 21 patented design is likely to cause the consumers to 22 purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the 23 patentee\\'s product. So in the VW Beetle example -- I 24 can\\'t bring myself to call it a \"bug.\" In the VW Beetle 25 example, nobody would look at the cup-holder that was\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n49 1 similar to what was in a VW Beetle that was in a Jeep or 2 a Porsche and say, oh, this must be a VW. But somebody 3 who looked at the exterior of a Jeep that copied the 4 iconic side profile of the VW Beetle might very well say 5 that, and a jury would take that into account. 6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the approach -- is the 7 approach that you\\'re discussing fairly described as 8 \"apportionment,\" or is that a bad word? 9 MR. WAXMAN: That is a really bad word. And 10 if there\\'s a -- I mean, in some -11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What other -- what -- what 12 word would you use to describe your approach? 13 MR. WAXMAN: What is the thing, the article 14 of manufacture, to which the design is applied for 15 purposes of sale in order to give it a distinctive and 16 pleasing appearance. Apportionment is what their 17 expert, Mr. Wagner, tried to do in his report saying the 18 total profits on the phone are X hundreds of millions of 19 dollars, but I find that only one percent of consumers 20 buy phones because of the front face of the phone either 21 off or on. 22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But once you\\'ve identified 23 the relevant article, then it seems to me necessarily 24 what you\\'re doing is apportioning profits. I just don\\'t 25 see how we can get away from that word.\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n50 1 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. In this sense, Justice 2 Kennedy, the vernacular sense of \"apportionment,\" once 3 you -- if you -- if the jury answers the question at 4 step 1 and says no, no, no, the article of manufacture 5 is the refrigerator latch or the cup-holder, how do we 6 determine total profits from the sale of that thing? 7 You do have to engage in a kind of an apportionment that 8 looks to how much did it cost to make the cup-holder and 9 what is the -- you know, what is the profit margin for 10 the car or the refrigerator or something like that. 11 That, it seems to me, is the way that you would do it if 12 you found it. 13 So, you know, in this case it\\'s a little 14 difficult to figure out what the alternative article of 15 manufacture would be. I mean, in the trial court even 16 before the trial judge, they never even suggested what 17 the article of manufacture could be for the 305 patent, 18 the graphical user interface. And -19 JUSTICE ALITO: Listing factors is not 20 helpful unless the jury or whoever the fact finder is 21 knows what the determination must -- what determination 22 must be made. The factors are helpful in making the 23 determination. 24 Now what you just said about the article of 25 manufacture is, it is the thing to which the design is\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n51 1 applied. Is that -- is that basically what you said? 2 MR. WAXMAN: What I would tell the jury is 3 quoting the statute and this Court\\'s decision in 1872 4 decision in Gorham, is that the article of manufacture 5 is the thing to which the design is applied for purposes 6 of sale, and to which it gives distinctive and pleasing, 7 attractive appearance. That\\'s all you\\'re trying to find 8 out -9 JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah, but in a physical 10 sense -- that -- you can answer it easily, and that\\'s 11 what the Chief Justice was talking about. It\\'s applied 12 to the outside in a physical sense. But you mean it in 13 a different sense, and I don\\'t really understand what -14 what that means. Once you get beyond the pure -- where 15 is the design applied? Is it applied to the inside? 16 No. It\\'s applied to the outside. 17 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the design, by 18 definition, applies to the outside. It has to apply to 19 something that -20 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So when you say what 21 it\\'s applied to, you\\'re not talking about it in terms of 22 the physical world, so what is -- what are you talking 23 about? 24 MR. WAXMAN: The jury is being asked to 25 decide was this -- if you find that this was a -- that\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n52 1 this was a patentable design and you find under Gorham 2 that it was infringed, what is the thing to which that 3 design was applied to give it a pleasing appearance. 4 Obviously, it\\'s not a transistor or some circuit or the 5 software. It is applied to the phone. Now, they could 6 if they had, if they had wanted to, suggested to the 7 jury no, no, no, the relevance -8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It\\'s applied to the 9 outside of the phone. 10 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it\\'s applied -11 Justice -- Mr. Chief justice, it\\'s always applied to the 12 outside of an article. It has to be applied to the 13 outside of an article. 14 I see my time is expired. Thank you very 15 much. 16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 17 Miss Sullivan. Four minutes. 18 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 19 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 20 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 21 please the Court: 22 Justice Kennedy, Congress did not say that 23 all apportionment is forbidden. Congress said you can\\'t 24 apportion the value of the design in relation to the 25 article. We\\'re conceding that here. What Congress did\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n53 1 not say is you can\\'t segregate the proper article from 2 the other articles that make up the product. So we can 3 segregate article from other articles within the 4 product. And, in fact, Section 289 requires us to do 5 that because it allows total profit only from that 6 article of manufacture to which the design has applied. 7 Now, the test that we ask the Court to 8 announce on remand. As has been discussed, it has two 9 parts. 10 The first is -- the antecedent question is 11 identify the relevant article of manufacture. Sometimes 12 that will be very easy if you do it from two main 13 factors. What does the patent scope claim, a front 14 face, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing? 15 And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for the 16 instruction, you allude to it, blue brief 21, we 17 actually asked the jury to be told that where the 18 article of manufacture is a case or external housing, 19 that\\'s the article of manufacture. 20 The second question is quantum of profits. 21 And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in saying 22 that a lot of the expert determinations about how much 23 did the Beetle exterior drive demand will come into 24 play, as the government said and we agree, only at the 25 second question: What is the quantum of profits from\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 the right article of manufacture?\\n\\n54\\n\\n2 But, Justice Alito, you asked how similar\\n\\n3 are we to the government\\'s test? And, Justice Kennedy,\\n\\n4 you asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistency\\n\\n5 among juries.\\n\\n6 We think the answer to the first question\\n\\n7 can be made more consistent and uniform if we focus\\n\\n8 mainly on two factors: What does the design in the\\n\\n9 patent claim: front face, exterior casing holding the\\n\\n10 front face? And second, what is the product to which it\\n\\n11 has been applied? That will help judges to guide\\n\\n12 juries.\\n\\n13 We think we should have had instruction\\n\\n14 42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summary\\n\\n15 judgment that the article of manufacture is the front\\n\\n16 face, and that could be instructed to the jury.\\n\\n17 JUSTICE BREYER: The problem, of course, is\\n\\n18 that Congress meant the whole wallpaper, even though\\n\\n19 they only want to apply it to the front.\\n\\n20 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --\\n\\n21 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s the problem in\\n\\n22 the case. So I thought -- and that\\'s why I pointed to\\n\\n23 the brief I did point to -- that history is matters\\n\\n24 here, and we\\'re talking here about a multicomponent\\n\\n25 product.\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n55 1 MS. SULLIVAN: That\\'s right, Your Honor. 2 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you don\\'t tell the 3 jury that there is that distinction, I think you either 4 disregard what Congress meant in its statute or you 5 create the kind of absurd results that your brief is 6 full of. So that\\'s what I\\'m looking for. 7 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor -8 JUSTICE BREYER: And that\\'s why I looked at 9 page 23, and it says that seems to do it. 10 MS. SULLIVAN: We\\'re fine with page 23 of 11 the tech company\\'s brief, and that points to why you 12 must remand in this case. 13 This case was tried under the improper rule 14 of law. We tried at every juncture to get the correct 15 rule of law adopted. And the district court said, I 16 forbade apportionment. And we said, no, no, we\\'re not 17 asking for apportionment; we\\'re asking for article of 18 manufacture. And we were shut down over and over again 19 on that. 20 So you must remand and tell the nation\\'s 21 economy that no one can claim a partial design patent on 22 a portion of a front face of an electronic device and 23 come in and get the entire profits on the phone. Juries 24 should be instructed that the article of manufacture 25 either is the Beetle exterior or there might be, Justice\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial - Subject to Final Review\\n1 Breyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary\\n\\n56\\n\\n2 articles, just like the Dobson rugs. The Gorham spoon\\n\\n3 might be a unitary article. The patents on the handle,\\n\\n4 but nobody really cares about the sipping cup of the\\n\\n5 spoon. So we say the article of manufacture is the\\n\\n6 spoon. And if you get the profits from the spoon,\\n\\n7 that\\'s all right.\\n\\n8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who has the burden of\\n\\n9 showing what is the relevant article? I assume in a\\n\\n10 case like this, Apple will say it\\'s the whole phone.\\n\\n11 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, if I leave\\n\\n12 you with the most important disagreement we have with\\n\\n13 the government and with Apple, the burden is on the\\n\\n14 plaintiff. The burden is on the plaintiff to show what\\n\\n15 the article of manufacture is.\\n\\n16 Why is that? The burden is on the plaintiff\\n\\n17 to show damages. And subsidiary questions subsumed in\\n\\n18 what the damages are are also always the plaintiff\\'s\\n\\n19 burden, as the entire market value rule in the Federal\\n\\n20 Circuit shows. With respect, we request that you\\n\\n21 remand -- vacate and remand.\\n\\n22 Thank you very much, Your Honor.\\n\\n23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\\n\\n24 The case is submitted.\\n\\n25 (Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the\\n\\nAlderson Reporting Company\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial -

The cleaning doesn't have to be perfect, but try to get as many of them as you can without deleting other numbers.\n",

    "Step 3 and 4. **chop off the beginning/ chop off the end**: now it would be very helpful to get rid of all of the text that comes before the arguments begins, and all the text that comes after the argument (each page has a really annoying index at the end that you don't want to be searching through). Look for words or phrases that uniquely repeat at the beginning and at the end of the arguments. The easiest way to isolate this, to do a simple split() on one of those phrases, and keep the half of The split you want. (Am I being too cryptic here?--a good split should give you list with two elements when you want to keep one of them) Think about it and email me.\n",

That result makes no sense. A single design patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the profit on the entire phone.

We respectfully ask that the Court hold that when a design patent claims a design that is applied to a component of a phone or a component of a product, or, to use the language of Section 289, when a design patent is applied to an article of manufacture within a multi-article product, we request that you hold that Section 289 entitles the patent-holder to total profit on the article of manufacture to which the design patent is applied, and not the profits on the total product'),\n",

To answer Justice Ginsburg's question, there are three ways Apple could have but did not even attempt to prove the total profit from the relevant article of manufactures here, the front face, or the display screen. One could have been accounting. One could have been consumer demand evidence, Justice Kennedy, as you suggested. Apple could have said well, people really like the front face disproportionately to all the other parts of the phone, so they could have used consumer survey evidence to prove that. But -- and so accounting evidence or indirect evidence through consumer survey. But, Your Honor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the total profit from the article of manufacture may sometimes be a substantial part of the total profit on the product. Let's take the Beetle, or let's take a cool, shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette. It may be that the article of manufacture to which the design patent is applied is just the exterior body of the car, but it may be that nobody really wants to pay much for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle. They want to pay for the cool way it looks. If that's so, it should be open to the patent-holder to prove that the bulk of the profits come from the exterior of the car\"),\n",

Let me give you an example with a phone's  front face. Consumers may value the front face because  it's scratch-resistant, because it's water-resistant,  because it's shatterproof. We're going to give the  patent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test all  the profits for the front face, even if it includes  profit from those non-design features of the front face,  where the pure apportionment test or pure causation test  would limit the profits to the profits from the design  parts rather than the functional parts. So, Your Honor,  that's a little bit overinclusive. We're getting a  little more with article of manufacture than we do with  a pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happy  for that.  But the reason we think it's consistent with  Congress's purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congress  was trying to do was provide a rule that gives  design-patent holders total profit from the article of  manufacture.  13  That's a little bit overinclusive, because  if you get total profit on the rugs that were at issue  in the Dobson cases, you'll get a little profit from the  design, and there will be a little extra you're getting  perhaps from the fiber or the weave. We think Congress  was entitled to exercise its fact-finding power to say  that it is appropriate as a matter of causation to say  that design causes value in a single article product  like a rug\"),\n",

We said very clearly article of manufacture is less than the total phone and profit should be limited to the profit from the article. We said again in the jury instructions -- and here I would refer you respectfully to joint Appendix 206, 207 and to the result of that on petition Appendix 165A. What happened is we went to the court and we said please listen to us about article of manufacture, if you only get the total profit on the article. The district court said, no, I already said no apportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said no apportionment, she shut us out of both theories. The district court shut us out of article of manufacture as the basis for total profit, and it shut us out of causation or apportionment, which we don't press here. So that's twice. Our legal brief, our charge conference. And then again in our 50A and the key rulings on 50A at the close of evidence, we again said article is separate from apportionment, and the article here is less than the phone. At 197 we said at -- sorry. At JA197 we again said article is less than the phone. And in the 50B at the close of the first trial, we again said article is less than the phone. Second trial happens on certain phones. Again, in the 50A and the 50B, the trial court says again, I have ruled that there's no apportionment for design patents. You cannot talk to me about article of manufacture. We tried over and over and over again to get the article of manufacture's theory embraced, and we were rejected. And why does that matter, Your Honor? Because there was evidence in the case from which a reasonable, properly instructed jury could have found that the components were the front face, the front face, and the display screen. And the evidence came out of Apple's own witnesses, which we're certainly entitled to rely on. Your Honor, Apple's own witnesses again and again said what are you claiming. And when the witnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn't say the whole phone, the look and feel. They said we're claiming a very specific front face, and by the way, ignore the home button. We're claiming a very specific front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignore everything that's outside the dotted lines. And if I could just remind you that we've reprinted the patents for you to see, and they may look like an iPhone on page 7, which is the D'677. They may look like an iPhone in the D'087, which was in Blueberry, set 8, but the claim is not for the iPhone. The claim is for the small portion of the external appearance of the phone that is inside the solid line. Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line. It disclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines. And Your Honor, the question for the jury was not did people think that the look and feel of an iPhone was great. The question for the jury was did the very small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makes look substantially similar to the very small portion of the patent claim? Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis in this record for a conclusion that the entire product, profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profit from those articles.

If I  understood my friend Ms. Sullivan's presentation  correctly, the parties are now in agreement about both  of those legal questions.  Just to summarize briefly, first, the court  of appeals correctly held that Section 289's provision  for an award of total profits means that the  patent-holder can recover all of the profits from the  sale of the infringing articles and manufacture and not  just the portion of the profits that the patent-holder  can prove was caused by or attributable to the design as  opposed to other features of the article.  But second, we read the court of appeals'  opinion to have held that the relevant article of  manufacture for which profits are owed is always the  entire product that the infringer sells to customers.  And we think that's a mistake, and we understand all  parties to agree with that now.  Instead, the relevant article of manufacture  to which a patented design may be applied will sometimes  be a part or a component of a larger product sold in  commerce.

And the jury has to  decide in the case of the VW Beetle that you have either  a cup-holder or a patented hubcap, or the iconic shape  of the car, I think that a jury could very well conclude  that because someone who sees the iconic shape of a VW  Beetle and buys it thinks that they are buying the  Beetle, that is, after all the reason why the infringer  copied it.  The -- we know from Samsung's own documents  in this case, for example, that are recounted in our  brief, Samsung realized that it faced what this  executive called a crisis of design. And the crisis of  design was reflected, the documents show, in the  telephone company saying, you have to create something  like the iPhone, and a directive came out to create  something like the iPhone so we can stop use -- losing  sales.

Now, as Justice Alito said, some people don't care a wit about the shape of the car. They want  44 just a small car. They want the car that has a certain trunk. People buy cars for a multitude of reasons. Experts would come in and say, but it's 90 percent of the profits. It may be that the body accounts for only percent of the cost of the car, but 90 percent of the profits are attributable to the shape of the car. What's wrong with that analysis?

The real difficulty is in calculating a hundred percent of the profits from that article of manufacture. The -- the few courts that have addressed  this that I've seen it have done it in a way that I  45  think probably makes the most sense and is the least  difficult conceptually which is to say, okay, what were  the costs of producing that article, that particular  subcomponent, and what was the company's profit margin  on the product as a whole applied to that little  component?

That is  relatively straightforward when, in a contested case,  46 the jury concludes that the article of manufacture is the product that's sold. It is more complicated when the jury concludes that the relevant article of manufacture, as was the case in the piano cases where customers could choose an array of cases in which to put the piano mechanism, it is more difficult to figure out total profits from the manufacture and sale of the case. But the decided cases that I have seen have looked at the question what was the manufacture -- what were the direct costs associated with producing the relevant piano cases and what was the profit margin on the piano as applied to that. And may I just add one other point which I think is still on track. The problem with that is that it runs headlong into the kind of thing that Congress was concerned about in 1887 when it passed the Design Patent Act, because the concern was that counterfeiters and copyists would -- if the only penalty -- if the only compensation was something that could be viewed as the cost of doing business, that is okay, you're going to get a percent margin on $2.50 for what it cost to produce this little component, there would be no deterrents to what Congress deemed to be an emergency.

But  that's the principal reason why the product has been  successful. I mean, the car has to run, and it has to  do all the other things that cars do, but the principal  reason why the car has been successful has to do with  this particular appearance, the design.  As I understood the government, that does  not come into the first inquiry. That does not come  into the question of what is the article.

I  think that the government\\'s -- if you look at the  government\\'s factors, you know, one factor is the  relative prominence of the design within the product as  a whole. And the government says that whether the  design -- in other words, whether the design is a  48 significant attribute of the entire product affecting the appearance of the product as a whole would suggest that the article should be the product. Another factor in the government\\'s test is the physical relationship between the patented design and the rest of the product. In other words, as the government\\'s brief says, can the user or the seller physically separate it, or is it manufactured separately. Another factor is whether the design is conceptually different from the product as a whole, as, for example, a design on a book binding is different from the intellectual property reflected in the copyright material in the book. Those -- we agree with all those factors as relevant, but I do think directly, you know, speaking to the question that you raised, the first factor that I mentioned, the relative prominence of the design within the product of the whole is in essence asking -- and it is a relevant question in determining the article of manufacture -- whether the patented design is likely to cause the consumers to purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the patentee\\'s product. So in the VW Beetle example -- I can\\'t bring myself to call it a \"bug.\" In the VW Beetle example, nobody would look at the cup-holder that was  49 similar to what was in a VW Beetle that was in a Jeep or a Porsche and say, oh, this must be a VW.

What Congress did  53 not say is you can't segregate the proper article from the other articles that make up the product. So we can segregate article from other articles within the product. And, in fact, Section 289 requires us to do that because it allows total profit only from that article of manufacture to which the design has applied. Now, the test that we ask the Court to announce on remand. As has been discussed, it has two parts. The first is -- the antecedent question is identify the relevant article of manufacture. Sometimes that will be very easy if you do it from two main factors. What does the patent scope claim, a front face, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing? And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for the instruction, you allude to it, blue brief 21, we actually asked the jury to be told that where the article of manufacture is a case or external housing, that's the article of manufacture. The second question is quantum of profits. And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in saying that a lot of the expert determinations about how much did the Beetle exterior drive demand will come into play, as the government said and we agree, only at the second question: What is the quantum of profits from  the right article of manufacture?  54  But, Justice Alito, you asked how similar  are we to the government's test? And, Justice Kennedy,  you asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistency  among juries.  We think the answer to the first question  can be made more consistent and uniform if we focus  mainly on two factors: What does the design in the  patent claim: front face, exterior casing holding the  front face? And second, what is the product to which it  has been applied? That will help judges to guide  juries.

Apple could have said well, people really like the front face disproportionately to all the other parts of the phone, so they could have used consumer survey evidence to prove that. But -- and so accounting evidence or indirect evidence through consumer survey. But, Your Honor, as to the Beetle, we concede that the total profit from the article of manufacture may sometimes be a substantial part of the total profit on the product. Let's take the Beetle, or let's take a cool, shark-shaped exterior body on a car like the Corvette. It may be that the article of manufacture to which the design patent is applied is just the exterior body of the car, but it may be that nobody really wants to pay much for the innards of the Corvette or the Beetle.

We're going to give the  patent-holder under our article-of-manufacture test all  the profits for the front face, even if it includes  profit from those non-design features of the front face,  where the pure apportionment test or pure causation test  would limit the profits to the profits from the design  parts rather than the functional parts. So, Your Honor,  that's a little bit overinclusive. We're getting a  little more with article of manufacture than we do with  a pure causation test, and plaintiffs should be happy  for that.  But the reason we think it's consistent with  Congress's purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congress  was trying to do was provide a rule that gives  design-patent holders total profit from the article of  manufacture.  13  That's a little bit overinclusive, because  if you get total profit on the rugs that were at issue  in the Dobson cases, you'll get a little profit from the  design, and there will be a little extra you're getting  perhaps from the fiber or the weave.

We said very clearly article of manufacture is less than the total phone and profit should be limited to the profit from the article. We said again in the jury instructions -- and here I would refer you respectfully to joint Appendix 206, 207 and to the result of that on petition Appendix 165A. What happened is we went to the court and we said please listen to us about article of manufacture, if you only get the total profit on the article. The district court said, no, I already said no apportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said no apportionment, she shut us out of both theories. The district court shut us out of article of manufacture as the basis for total profit, and it shut us out of causation or apportionment, which we don't press here. So that's twice. Our legal brief, our charge conference. And then again in our 50A and the key rulings on 50A at the close of evidence, we again said article is separate from apportionment, and the article here is less than the phone. At 197 we said at -- sorry. At JA197 we again said article is less than the phone. And in the 50B at the close of the first trial, we again said article is less than the phone. Second trial happens on certain phones. Again, in the 50A and the 50B, the trial court says again, I have ruled that there's no apportionment for design patents. You cannot talk to me about article of manufacture. We tried over and over and over again to get the article of manufacture's theory embraced, and we were rejected. And why does that matter, Your Honor? Because there was evidence in the case from which a reasonable, properly instructed jury could have found that the components were the front face, the front face, and the display screen. And the evidence came out of Apple's own witnesses, which we're certainly entitled to rely on. Your Honor, Apple's own witnesses again and again said what are you claiming. And when the witnesses got on to talk about infringement, they didn't say the whole phone, the look and feel. They said we're claiming a very specific front face, and by the way, ignore the home button. We're claiming a very specific front face and surrounding bezel, and by the way, ignore everything that's outside the dotted lines. And if I could just remind you that we've reprinted the patents for you to see, and they may look like an iPhone on page 7, which is the D'677. They may look like an iPhone in the D'087, which was in Blueberry, set 8, but the claim is not for the iPhone. The claim is for the small portion of the external appearance of the phone that is inside the solid line. Apple disclaimed everything outside the solid line. It disclaimed portions of the front face with dotted lines. And Your Honor, the question for the jury was not did people think that the look and feel of an iPhone was great. The question for the jury was did the very small portion of a smartphone that Samsung makes look substantially similar to the very small portion of the patent claim? Now that, Your Honor, there is no basis in this record for a conclusion that the entire product, profit on the phone, corresponds to the entire profit from those articles.

Just to summarize briefly, first, the court  of appeals correctly held that Section 289's provision  for an award of total profits means that the  patent-holder can recover all of the profits from the  sale of the infringing articles and manufacture and not  just the portion of the profits that the patent-holder  can prove was caused by or attributable to the design as  opposed to other features of the article.  But second, we read the court of appeals'  opinion to have held that the relevant article of  manufacture for which profits are owed is always the  entire product that the infringer sells to customers.  And we think that's a mistake, and we understand all  parties to agree with that now.  Instead, the relevant article of manufacture  to which a patented design may be applied will sometimes  be a part or a component of a larger product sold in  commerce.

Congress -- when Congress said that you are entitled, you know, in response to the Dobson cases, that as an alternative remedy, if there is infringement of a design -- which, by the way, does not happen innocently.

Another factor in the government\\'s test is the physical relationship between the patented design and the rest of the product. In other words, as the government\\'s brief says, can the user or the seller physically separate it, or is it manufactured separately. Another factor is whether the design is conceptually different from the product as a whole, as, for example, a design on a book binding is different from the intellectual property reflected in the copyright material in the book. Those -- we agree with all those factors as relevant, but I do think directly, you know, speaking to the question that you raised, the first factor that I mentioned, the relative prominence of the design within the product of the whole is in essence asking -- and it is a relevant question in determining the article of manufacture -- whether the patented design is likely to cause the consumers to purchase the infringing product thinking it to be the patentee\\'s product.

       "  \" Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Kennedy, Congress did not say that all apportionment is forbidden. Congress said you can't apportion the value of the design in relation to the article. We're conceding that here. What Congress did  53 not say is you can't segregate the proper article from the other articles that make up the product. So we can segregate article from other articles within the product. And, in fact, Section 289 requires us to do that because it allows total profit only from that article of manufacture to which the design has applied. Now, the test that we ask the Court to announce on remand. As has been discussed, it has two parts. The first is -- the antecedent question is identify the relevant article of manufacture. Sometimes that will be very easy if you do it from two main factors. What does the patent scope claim, a front face, or as the Chief Justice said, the exterior casing? And, in fact, we asked Mr. Chief Justice for the instruction, you allude to it, blue brief 21, we actually asked the jury to be told that where the article of manufacture is a case or external housing, that's the article of manufacture. The second question is quantum of profits. And I think Justice Kagan put it exactly right in saying that a lot of the expert determinations about how much did the Beetle exterior drive demand will come into play, as the government said and we agree, only at the second question: What is the quantum of profits from  the right article of manufacture?  54  But, Justice Alito, you asked how similar  are we to the government's test? And, Justice Kennedy,  you asked if this will lead to a lot of inconsistency  among juries.  We think the answer to the first question  can be made more consistent and uniform if we focus  mainly on two factors: What does the design in the  patent claim: front face, exterior casing holding the  front face? And second, what is the product to which it  has been applied? That will help judges to guide  juries.  We think we should have had instruction  42.1, but in a proper case, you might decide at summary  judgment that the article of manufacture is the front  face, and that could be instructed to the jury\"),\n",

And we said, no, no, we're not asking for apportionment; we're asking for article of manufacture. And we were shut down over and over again on that. So you must remand and tell the nation's economy that no one can claim a partial design patent on a portion of a front face of an electronic device and come in and get the entire profits on the phone. Juries should be instructed that the article of manufacture either is the Beetle exterior or there might be, Justice  Breyer, still today, there might be cases of unitary  56  articles, just like the Dobson rugs.

A \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is a court that has an independent source of subject-matter jurisdiction. That is what this Court has held five times those words mean. So let\\'s start with the plain language. The statute grants Freddie, quote, \"The power in its corporate name to sue and be sued in any \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\' State or Federal.\" The only reference to jurisdiction in that passage is to say that you don\\'t get to go to any Federal court or any State court, but rather, you have to choose a court, State or Federal, that must be a \"court of competent jurisdiction.\" And the only way to find out whether a court is a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is to examine the statutes creating that court and granting it jurisdiction',\n",

And the -- the cases that my friends rely upon at Fannie that talk about personal jurisdiction are cases in which there was already subject-matter jurisdiction. And this Court held, hold on. Wait a minute. It\\'s not enough just to have subject-matter jurisdiction, which everyone agreed there was in those cases. It needs to be personal jurisdiction. Now, five times this Court has interpreted the words \"competent jurisdiction\" to mean, quote, \"outside\" -- \"outside sources of jurisdictional authority.\" That\\'s from Phoenix. Or from Shoshone; this Court held that any reference to competent  jurisdiction -- excuse me -- that a reference to  competent jurisdiction means, and I quote, \"it  unquestionably meant that the competency of the court  should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in  respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.\"  And Fannie\\'s interpretation simply does not  map onto the statutory language that Congress wrote.  Look at the sentence. Fannie\\'s interpretation would  require the Court to read the phrase \"competent  jurisdiction\" to mean different things depending upon  which word modifies it.  So Fannie concedes that the clause referring  to any \"court of competent jurisdiction\" State cannot be  read as a grant of jurisdiction to every State court.

The Federal Court of Claims -- excuse me.  The Court of Federal Claims does not have competent  jurisdiction except if those jurisdictional requirements  are otherwise satisfied.  And Fannie has never explained how you can  take the same language and map it out differently to  reach different results depending upon which word it  modifies and even different results when it modifies the  same word.

And Congress chose language that, per Justice Breyer\\'s question, it was assured would not grant jurisdiction. Step was 1954. So now D\\'Oench has been decided. And what did Congress do? It did the opposite of what happened in Red Cross. In Red Cross, remember, there was a provision that didn\\'t match D\\'Oench, and then Congress takes a left turn and says, we\\'re going to match D\\'Oench. Here, Congress began with a provision that matched what was later assessed in D\\'Oench and took a right turn and added the words \"competent jurisdiction,\" which this Court had previously, for example, in Phoenix, defined to mean, quote, \"depends on other provisions of law.\" Step was 1974. After the shift to private entity was consummated, Congress further amended the charter to provide litigants with a source of diversity jurisdiction, because there was no source of Federal jurisdiction after Fannie went private and then was no longer an agency. If there was a source of jurisdiction in this sue-or-be-sued clause, there would be no purpose for diversity jurisdiction.

We think there is a plausible story for why Congress in 1954 wanted to eliminate the sue-and-be-sued clause as a basis for Federal jurisdiction, but even if you don\\'t find that explanation completely satisfying, the text of the statute should control. The point of the Red Cross rule was to tell Congress, if you use this specific language, this entity may sue or be sued in any court of law or equity, State or Federal, this Court will take that to mean that Congress is creating subject-matter jurisdiction in the Federal courts. In this case, the Court should give Congress the further guidance that if it uses the -- the language \"suit is authorized in a State or Federal \\'court of competent jurisdiction,\\'\" then that means that you have to look to some other provision of law to see if that court is vested with jurisdiction',\n",

Now, counsel mentioned five cases of this  Court that have interpreted the phrase \"competent  29  jurisdiction.\" What this Court needs to understand  about those cases is the number of those five cases that  interpreted \"competent jurisdiction\" together with the  phrase \"State or Federal\" is zero. No case, not  Shoshone, not Phoenix, not Califano v. Sanders, looked  at the two phrases together.

First of all, from Congress\\'s perspective at the time, I think it\\'s fair to say they weren\\'t thinking about much, because the 1954 Act was a 150-page comprehensive reform of Federal housing policy having very little to do with jurisdiction.  32 And we think what happened is they simply borrowed a phrase that had been unanimously held to confer jurisdiction, and they put it in for Fannie Mae. There was no other reason to think they meant anything different from that. But we also know that less than two years before the 1954 charter for Fannie Mae was adopted, this Court looked at the phrase \"competent jurisdiction\" on a standalone basis and said that all it referred to at that time in that context was personal jurisdiction. That doesn\\'t mean that\\'s what \"competent jurisdiction\" means always. But what we think it means is when coupled with the words \"State\" or \"Federal,\" it means personal jurisdiction courts of general jurisdiction. Now, Justice Sotomayor earlier asked the question about how many statutes had sue-and-be-sued clauses like ours. We have the same count, Your Honor, that your clerk has. We have nine total, including Fannie Mae',\n",

Now, Justice Ginsburg, the issue about Freddie Mac is severalfold. So the first thing we know is when Freddy was created in 1970, the legislative history in both the House Report and the Senate Report make crystal clear that Congress's intention was to create an entity that had identical powers that would develop in parallel and that would have no advantage over Fannie Mae. We know that was their intention in drafting it. Now, the words were unquestionably different, just as the words in the Red Cross charter were different from the words in the Second Bank of the United States charter, and yet the outcome was the same. The reason the words were different at the time is because Congress had the luxury, in 1970, of writing in a blank slate.

And that respect is if the colloquy related to the  statute that created Fannie Mae. That would make it  clearer.  But as it turns out, the 1934 statute that  counsel cites in the briefing was not the statute that  created Fannie Mae, and so it\\'s not that much more  probative than if it had been the legislative history of  an utterly unrelated statute. Okay?  In 1934, in the Housing Act, Congress  authorized the creation of entirely different private  mortgage associations which never came into being. The  sort of hope in the middle of the Depression in 1934 was  that private capital would come into the market pursuant  to that statute in places, if you read the rest of the  38 legislative history, in places like Houston, Texas, and Chicago, and New York, and would start creating liquidity to solve the problem. So in 1938, a new statute was passed. That was the same year, I might add, that Senator Bulkley, the Senator whose legislative history is quoted, lost his re-election campaign',\n",

In the earlier case law of Blackmar v.

       "  ' Correct. That\\'s exactly right.  And, again, because this is a case about Congress\\'  intention in adopting a statute, what is critical to  understand is when Congress borrowed this language that  had pre-existed for the Federal Housing Administration  for years and grafted it onto Fannie Mae in its  verbatim entirety, every case that had interpreted that  language had held it was sufficient to confer  subject-matter jurisdiction so strongly that in the  Seven Oaks case in 1948 in the Fourth Circuit just six  years before our statute, the Fourth Circuit said that  those words were no more restrictive than the phrase \"in  any United States District Court.\" That\\'s the tapestry  on which Congress was weaving at the time.  Now, let me address, if I might just  briefly, the policy issue. We talked about the text and  the history. But counsel spent a few moments talking  about this privatization concept and how it would be  42  that what must have happened in the \\'50s was Congress  was going to treat Fannie Mae like any other private  company and deprive it of special access to the Federal  courts.  The presumption behind that argument is  that, naturally, Congress would never want a privately  owned company to have special access, except we know  from the Second Bank of the United States in Osborn that  there are times when a privately owned company is  sufficiently important, it can have special access. The  Second Bank was 80 percent owned by private  shareholders.  Fast-forward two centuries to 1970, we know  that Freddie Mac was created entirely privately owned at  its inception with clear and undisputed access to the  Federal courts, admittedly with different language, of  course, because it was writing in a different era and  writing on a different slate without all the baggage  that Fannie Mae had gone through. But there\\'s no  question that privately owned instrumentalities when  pursuing a federally important purpose like housing can  qualify under these circumstances.  But the other problem with their theory if  it fails as a theoretical matter is that it also fails  43 in its mechanism. The truth is this: Congress did not privatize Fannie Mae in 1954. On the contrary, even when Fannie Mae became privately owned, under the 1954 Act, it remained a Federal government agency and it still had special access to the Federal courts under 1345. So if there had been a conscious legislative judgment to take Fannie out of the Federal courts at that time, they surely would have had to do the work of taking away its agency status',\n",

It was written at a time when we were connected with multiple other agencies. We were part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. We comprised what became Ginnie Mae. And our language was an attempt to do  45 essentially removal surgery, to separate us from this big accretion of language over decades. Freddie Mac didn't have that problem. So Freddie Mac is what one would do if you were starting from scratch. I will say, I am reminded of Justice Kagan's colloquy in the last argument, though, about what would happen to a Hill staffer looking at the 1954 statute. And I'm trying to imagine what would happen to the poor Hill staffer if he came and he said, well, listen. We -- we'd like to change Fannie Mae's language. We want to add this competent jurisdiction language. Now, that's only been looked at three times before, and all of those cases said that confers jurisdiction. But we think that was just dicta or perhaps wrong, and so we would go ahead and use it as a way of removing jurisdiction. That doesn't sound plausible any more in this case than it did in the prior case to me, given what the case law backdrop was of the time. Now, if I might, I'd like to say one point about the Freddie Mac issue, because, obviously, you know, we are sister companies. Obviously, Freddie Mac has different language. The question is, is this a good thing for our side? Is it a bad thing for our side?  46 Our view basically is Congress said what it meant in the 1970 reports, House and Senate. It said that companies were supposed to be parallel. They were supposed to have no advantages over each other and have all the same powers. The question for this Court is: Why would Congress -- although it used a different language across multiple powers -- why would it have wanted Freddie Mac to have the same mortgage acquisition powers, the same securitization powers, the same tax exemptions and SEC exceptions, the same access to treasury lines of credit, but have different Federal court litigating powers? There's no answer to that. And all we know is that in terms of the Federal interest in access to the Federal courts, what we know is that Fannie is the same as Freddie Mac, only much, much bigger. So it doesn't make a lot of sense to imagine that a $3 trillion dollar company, the largest company in the United States by assets, creating housing across the country just like Freddie Mac would have been intended not to be protected by Federal court jurisdiction\",\n",

Freddie Mac was created the way that the Congress of 1970 would have wanted it. Fannie Mae wasn't. Fannie Mae was inherited from generations earlier and had to be torn apart from Ginnie Mae. That's why the original board of the private Fannie Mae in 1968 consisted of Paul Volcker, who at the time was a former HUD Undersecretary. It consisted of a former general counsel of HUD.

       "  ' Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think because this is largely an international trade case, it\\'s probably useful to put this case in context and to compare it to the facts that gave rise to the passage of Section 271(f) that\\'s at issue in this case. You\\'ll recall that in the Deepsouth case, that was a case involving a shrimp deveiner in which all of the activities took place within the United States, except for the final act that took less than an hour to assemble in a foreign country. In that case, this Court held even that was not within the meaning of the -- of the patent statute as it existed then, and Congress then acted to fill that particular loophole. The facts of this case seem to me to be the polar opposite of that. With -- Life Tech has -- Life Technologies operates an -- an enormous plant in   England, in the United Kingdom. It spends tens of  million dollars on that plant. Four out of the five  components that go into the creation of the kits that  are at issue in this case are sourced outside of the  United States; one inside. I\\'ll come back to that in a  minute. And as relevant to this litigation, all of the  kit -- kits are sold outside of the United States.  So the only contact that any of this has  with the United States is the fact that a single,  commodity product is shipped to England as part of the  process for the fabrication of these particular kits.  Now, that commodity product is called a Taq  polymerase, which I will readily concede that when I  think about what you buy off-the-shelf, I don\\'t go to  Costco to buy Taq polymerase, but I\\'m told, and I think  it\\'s absolutely undisputed in the record, that this is a  commodity. This is at the essence of what the Congress  enacted in (f)(2), which is a staple article or  commodity of commerce suitable for many non-infringing  uses. And, indeed, if you get online and put in \"Taq  polymerase,\" you can find literally dozens and dozens of  ways to purchase it online at this time. And that was  true as much in 2006. It may have been a significant  product in 1989, but clearly by 2006, it was a  commodity. And so the question is, is whether or not, simply by using a single, staple article, Congress intended through 271 to -- to declare that this is -4',\n",

       "  \" Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We are asking the Court to do two things here today. First, we are asking the Court to hold that the supply of a single commodity component is never enough. We think that's clearly right when you look at (f)(1) and (f)(2) together, especially in light of extraterritoriality concerns. Second, we are asking the Court to hold that (f)(1) reaches the supply of all or a large portion of the components of the invention, not any important portion of the invention. And the way we had put it is that it reaches the supply of all or something tantamount to all of the components. And our principal practical concerns here stem from the breadth of the Federal Circuit's ruling, and it's broad because they are asking a loaded question that's looking only at part of the picture. If you look only at the supplied portion of the components and you ask whether they are important or essential to the operation or novelty of the invention, the answer is always going to be yes. In most inventions, if you take away any component, it isn't going to work and it's not going to be patentable. So we think you just can't come at it that way. And then the second piece is that the Federal Circuit isn't looking at all the components that were not supplied, and so they are not asking the comparative question of whether the person has done anything similar to supplying all of the components. And we think that's just a critical piece here. This is an anti-circumvention provision. It was enacted to shore up the basic territorial restriction against actually making a patented invention in the United States and then shipping it abroad, and we think it needs to be interpreted with that purpose in mind\",\n",

As this Court explained in Microsoft v.

That\\'s how you   know what the scope of the combination is.  34  And if Congress had said, you know, to  export one or more rather than a substantial portion,  you would still use the plural because the plural is  necessary to accommodate the instance in which it will,  in fact, commonly be more than one.  Now, in your hypothetical, if you\\'re talking  about a substantial portion of units that are  indistinguishable from each other, like pages of the  brief, then I concede that the more natural reading is a  quantitative one. But if you look at how \"substantial\"  is used in the relevant provisions, the provisions of  the patent code that my friend on the other side is  averting to, that is (f)(2), where substantial  non-infringing uses is plainly at least partly  qualitative, or, as they say, the Warner-Jenkinson, the  doctrine of equivalence case where equivalency turns on  substantiality of functions and methods and uses, it is  also qualitative, our argument is that, again, we agree  with the United States whether the extent to which  substantial is qualitative or quantitative depends on  the context.

Now, in this instance, and this goes, I think, to Justice Breyer\\'s question about extraterritoriality, Congress was very careful -- of course, as this Court recognized in Microsoft, there are extraterritorial implications because it concerns exporting things for something to be done in commerce overseas.

Let's assume that you have a patented pharmaceutical, a tablet that, you know, remediates a disease. It has -16 as is commonplace in these combinations, it has one active ingredient, and it has five inert ingredients that are as easy to pick up as you can imagine. The thing that is exported -- the -- the -20 the factory overseas, which by the way is never liable under the statute because the statute only applies to conduct in the United States, they -- they're happy to go down to their local warehouse and get the -- the five inert ingredients. But the -- the -- the molecule that does all   the work, they import from the United States.  39  Now, my friends on the other side would say,  and I believe Mr. Tripp actually did say, if that  molecule has no non-infringing uses, it's illegal. But  if it's such a great molecule that it actually has  another non-infringing use, say it also powers the  injectable form of the pharmaceutical, which is not  patented, that what Congress intended to do was leave  this giant doughnut hole in the rule between the active  inducement of a commodity, that is, non-bespoke  component.  You have to -- you know, there's no  liability at all. You have to supply all or nearly all  of those inert components, or you have to show that, you  know, there, in fact, is a patent on the injectable  form.  Or take also the example that was at issue  in this Court's decision in Quanta Computer. Justice  Thomas explained for the Court that that was a case that  involved the patent exhaustion doctrine where Intel was  supplying a very sophisticated microchip, microprocessor  that was used by Quanta Computer in a computer that had,  you know, gazillion other components.  And the question was whether Intel's sale of  the microprocessor to LGE, which then sold it to Quanta,   exhausted the patent. And what this Court said is,  40  well, it didn't exhaust the patent on the combination,  because, obviously, it's only one or two components.  But because that microchip -- that  microprocessor embodied the -- what it said was the  inventive aspect of the computer as a whole, we are  going to take account of that and hold that patent  exhaustion applies. And that would apply not only to my  pharmaceutical example or Justice Alito's, you know, one  super important component, it would apply to a more --  you know, the Quanta example where there may be -- say  there are components, but three of them constitute  the inventive aspect.  This -- the language is capacious enough and  can be read in a commonsense way to make clear that that  is what Congress intended to address in (f)(1) by  enacting -- provided there is active encouragement for  the combination, by enacting the analog, the -- the (f)  analog to what is active inducement under (b)\",\n",

The reason this came up to the Seventh Circuit as it did -- and this may be important in understanding the context -- this is on a motion to dismiss for statute -- for violation of the statue of limitations. All of the claims were dismissed but one, the one that was appealed, and that one survived momentarily in the district court because Petitioner claimed that that one claim has a favorable termination element because it is malicious prosecution. He reiterated that claim before the Seventh Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit reached two conclusions. One, you have a Fourth Amendment claim which they discuss, and that the only claim before them was based on the lie at the Gerstein hearing. You have a Fourth Amendment claim, but it is already accrued; it accrued too early; it is untimely. Now you're asking us to recognize a different breed of Fourth Amendment claim, namely, a malicious prosecution Fourth Amendment claim, because you'd like to overcome the time bar.

The first time it says, when after the arrest a particular person is not let go when he should be -- so it\\'s after the initial seizure, and then the person is not let go, the Fourth Amendment gives way to the due process clause as a basis for challenging his detention. And then in the last paragraph it says, \"Once detention by reason of arrest turns into detention by reason of arraignment, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture.\" So it seems to me that twice, the Seventh  Circuit says very clearly that you have this Fourth  30  Amendment claim until arraignment or legal process, and  after that, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the  picture.

Now, the question of whether or not  malicious prosecution is the proper analogy, the answer  is absolutely not, and Wallace tells us why not.  Wallace tells us -- now, the Petitioner has shifted just  slightly from a reliance on common law favorable  termination, which is what most of the circuits on their  side of the split have done. This also goes, I think,  to Your Honor's question and to your point.  Most of the circuits on the other side of  the split have used favorable termination, but they've  done so by adopting it as part of the underlying  four-element common law tort, and they think if that's  what we're calling it, then it's going to have favorable  termination.  A smaller number have relied on an  extension, a drastic extension, of this Court's decision  in Heck. And that's the request now made by the  Petitioner in the reply brief, that Heck ought to be  expanded to apply here.  35 But Wallace was very clear. Heck only applies -- the delayed accrual principle and the favorable termination element that comes with it apply only where you have an extant conviction. And that doesn't exist here. The court went through a mental exercise. They said, look, if you can realize that you have a Fourth Amendment claim before you're convicted, if the elements can be in mind, you know you've been wronged in a Fourth Amendment way before you are convicted, then that is not a claim that is entitled to the delayed accrual principle of Heck. And the reason was very simple. Because as this Court said in Gerstein, Fourth Amendment contemplates that you can have bad arrests and good convictions. And nevertheless, the Fourth Amendment protects the innocent as well as the guilty. And expanding Heck to apply the circumstance where all you have is an ex parte requirement, or finding rather, of probable cause, requiring that civil plaintiff to then prove vindication at the end of the day would close the door on a potential universe of Fourth Amendment claims and instances\",\n",

If the question is why then doesn't the accrual period run from when one is ultimately released, I would make a couple of points in response to Your Honor's question. First, Petitioner has been very careful not to make that argument. Indeed, the continuing seizure idea would be inconsistent facially with the cert petition, which claimed they need the benefit of favorable termination to prevail. They, of course, wouldn't need it if they were instead arguing for a period of a continuing seizure. Lower courts have rejected the notion of a continuing seizure, and they're not raising it here. And I think the reason may be twofold.  37 The first is that it runs into -- it runs in the face of traditional accrual principles that this Court has said, cases like Ricks and others, that it's not the period of harm that matters for accrual purposes. It's when one first experiences the harm and thereby has all the elements needed to proceed. And a case like Morgan, which was a hostile work environment case, is really the exception that proves the rule. In many ways it tells us why or how narrowly the Court has -- has construed the exceptions to this typical accrual principle. Hostile work environment does require precisely what Your Honor describes because it's impossible to know precisely when a hostile work environment begins. Is it the second comment or the fifth or the tenth that someone has to endure in the workplace, and therefore, the Court is willing to consider it as a monolithic whole and treat it that way for accrual purposes. But again, that's the exception that proves the rule. As Wallace itself concluded, there can be a cutoff, which Wallace imposed between the initial arrest and the post-process arrest, and Wallace itself in that regard, I think, breaks through the notion of a continuing seizure. The final point I would make -- and I think  38 this comes out in one of their amicus briefs; namely, the brief by Professor Alschuler -- taken to its logical conclusion, the logic of continuing seizure may lead one to conclude that the seizure doesn't end until the ultimate period of incarceration concludes. And what that means is now you have potential civil plaintiffs bringing claims 10, 15, years down the road without any prior notice to the would-be defendants, no ability to maintain evidence and so forth\",\n",

They've made the point that early notice to the State as employer of agents who are engaged in bad acts is extraordinarily important. Government is intent upon learning sooner rather than later that they have individuals in their ranks that are violating the Constitution. And this Court in Wallace, in turning aside basically the same extension of Heck that is recommended for the Court, or the Court's invited to take in this very case, when they turned it away, they said one of the reasons is we need notice to the would-be defendants in those cases.

I'd like to just turn for a moment as to why  we feel our -- our position makes sense, because we  framed our second argument in our brief as ensuring the  purpose of the veteran keep all of his disability pay,  both in form and in substance.  I think it makes sense that Congress would  have wanted veterans to keep all their disability pay  for the obvious reason that it's the veteran who's  disabled. And the point of the disability pay is to  substitute for income that the veteran can't earn  because of his or her disability. That's how it's  defined. You get a disability rating if you have a  reduced income potential. And so I think that this --  it makes perfect sense. I think everyone agrees that  the veteran should keep the disability pay. The reason this dispute has come up is that Congress has made this decision to cut a veteran's pension or to force a veteran to waive a portion of his own pension, which has already been earned, if he also becomes disabled and accepts the disability pay. And that's a pretty harsh judgment that Congress made, essentially, to protect the public fisc, but that's what Congress did. So I think that what the statute is doing is saying if the veteran is forced to do that, then the veteran and the ex-spouse will both have their amounts reduced by an equal amount; in other words, what's divisible is just going to be the residual share. So I think that's what this statute is doing. And then if you frame it that way, I think it makes perfect sense to treat the pre-divorce scenario and the post-divorce scenario as parallel. Because I don't think that the goal of protecting disability pay really has anything to do with the timing of the disability relative to the divorce. In other words, if you have two disabled veterans and they're both divorced, I think that their interest in keeping their disability pay is the same, even if one of them happened to become disabled the year before his divorce and the other one happened to become disabled the year afterwards. So I think that, you know, framed in those terms, I think the -- the purpose of arguments don't distinguish between the pre-divorce and the post-divorce scenario\",\n",

       "  \" Mr. Chief Justice, and may it  please the Court:  The authority granted to the States by the  Former Spouses Protection Act to treat -- to treat  marital -- to treat Military Retirement Pay as property  and divide it necessarily operates at the time of the  divorce. The text of the Act, its primary purpose to protect the former spouse, and the practical realities of divorce make the time of divorce paramount. That is when family courts must determine the extent of all of the marital property, divide that property, and also coordinate the multiple moving parts of a divorce, which include spousal maintenance, which is often intertwined with the division of property. Now, the authority to divide Military Retirement Pay is limited only by the Act's exclusion of amounts of retirement pay that are then being deducted as the result of a previous waiver to receive disability benefits. And whether that division at the time of divorce occurs before the member's retirement, as the statute expressly allows, and, therefore, before any waiver has occurred, or the division occurs after retirement, the State law consequences of the property division must follow along. And those consequences can include the fact that the -- in -- in a particular State that the retirement pay awarded to a spouse is considered to be that spouse's vested property. And also, the consequential right of the State to formulate remedies to protect and affect that property right, to compensate for any damage that might be done to that property interest. And another consequence I -- that I think has come up here today is -- is that of the finality of the divorce decree and whether the State court has the ability to go back and modify -- after a waiver of retirement pay in favor of disability pay, to go back and modify a division of property. I think -7\",\n",

You know, one of the objectives of family law courts is to achieve finality and -- and not have folks coming back in the future. Certainly, child support and spousal maintenance can be exceptions, but there has to be a substantial and continuing change of circumstances in order to justify revisiting, reopening, modifying child support or spousal maintenance. But property division is -- is thought to be set in stone. At the time of divorce, the -- the spouses are splitting the sheets and the Court must determine how many sheets there are and how big they are and decide who gets what. And what that is -- what is decided at that point in time is what they have going forward.

And that is a ruling that I think we have to accept as this case reaches the Court; that's a state law interpretation which binds this Court. And so what the court held, however, is that it was not going to enforce the decree as written. It was going to import a State law rule that basically says that the relevant divisible asset was the total amount of the retirement pay and divide that. I think the court is quite clear. It's saying that it conceptualizes the property interests as the total amount of money that Petitioner was receiving, and it said that by waiving retirement pay, the Petitioner converted a portion of respondent's property. And so it's saying that Respondent holds a property  47 interest in half of that waived amount. So that's just the same thing as treating waived retirement pay as divisible. And so -4\",\n",

And if the veteran doesn't agree, then they'll just go to divorce court and there'll be a decree where the court, we would say, would have to just divide the retirement pay as mandated by Congress. Now, we agree that settlements are good. And there have been many reported cases where the  48 veteran says, look, I'll -- I'll make you this promise if you agree to give me, you know, the car or whatever. So we're not -- we're not reading this statute as impinging on settlements. But in this case, the court held that what the settlement was, was just dividing the pension whatever it was 50-50. The fact that Petitioner is required to pay this reimbursement order, it's not what he had agreed to; it's this order imposed by State law saying that it was going to treat Respondent as holding a property interest in half of the amount of the waived retirement pay, which we think is -- is what the Federal statute prohibits. And in response to Justice Sotomayor's question earlier, yes, I think that the reasonable expectation is that the waivers might occur. I think it's important to recognize that waivers of retirement pay for disability are not rare or obscure. There's hundreds of thousands of veterans who have done just that. And I don't think it's a tremendous shock to an experienced divorce lawyer that this might happen. And so during negotiations for a divorce settlement, this may come up. So I just think the idea that, you know, there's no way to predict this could conceivably happen, I think, is just inconsistent with the reality of -- of   divorce litigation in military divorces.  49  I'd like to respond to the -- the comments  of -- of counsel about other assets, that it's perfectly  fine to divide the accrual of disability pay as long as  there are just other assets used to fund it.  So first of all, I think that's quite  contrary to this Court's decision in Hillman and several  other cases. I think it's both counterintuitive, and I  think that the holding of those cases is that you can't  do that, because just the four corners of the -- the  Hillman holding was that, you know, Federal law preempts  a statute that doesn't directly act on property, but  just has property go into a bank account and then is  transferred to the other bank account, which is  essentially the same situation as here.  And I think it's also quite pertinent that  what the statute says is that it's division of waived  retirement pay that's impermissible. And recall that  waived retirement pay literally is not money you're  getting. The definition of waived retirement pay  literally is the money that you're not getting so you  can get disability pay. So when we talk about dividing  waived retirement pay, what just that inherently means  is forcing you to pay an amount from your general assets  equal to that waived retirement pay to the other spouse.   So I just think that, you know, it's not even just  50  legalistic. I just think the statute cannot be  construed to permit operation on the general assets.  And I just want to make one other point.  And, you know, Justice Sotomayor asked questions earlier  about sort of the policy distinctions between pre- and  post-divorce waivers. And we're not denying that  there's no policy distinctions at all. I mean, we can't  deny that. Of course there are differences in policy.  And I think that the interest of the disabled veteran is  the same before and after. But there are policy  distinctions at stake.  I think the question in this case is whether  this statute can be interpreted to recognize that those  policy distinctions and distinguished between those two  scenarios, and I just don't think you can't get it out  of the statutory text, which does prohibit waived  retirement pay from being treated as divisible no matter  when the waiver occurs.  If the Court has no further questions, I'll  rest. Thank you\",\n",

First, Your Honor, there's not always two phases. So even if the parties engage in the information exchange, it contemplates -- it gives the sponsor -- I mean, the applicant a great deal of control. The applicant can put all of the patents on the lists into that litigation. And if that happens, they -- there may never be a need for a second litigation if there are never any new patents. That's what happened in the Apotex case that's pending. There are no patents left, yet Apotex is subjected to the 180-day bar of the notice of commercial marketing provision. So -- and the purpose of the notice of commercial marketing provision, Justice Ginsburg, is that it lifts the gate. So once the parties go through   the information exchange, as Justice Sotomayor was  23  suggesting, that creates a stay of any litigation except  for the ones the parties agree to. The sponsor has  great control over that first litigation.  The point of the notice is to allow the  sponsor to litigate any other patents it might have  before the exclusivity period runs out. And the notice  does two things. It does two things. It lifts the gate  to allow the sponsor to bring any declaratory-judgment  actions. And it also says, if appropriate, the sponsor  seek a preliminary injunction. But, of course, if you  file an early-enough declaratory-judgment action, you  don't need a preliminary injunction.

So we don't know when the FDA -- how the FDA  will address a license application that is made during  the 12-year period.  But two panels of the Federal Circuit have  read the language of the statute that says -- and this  is 262(k)(7) -- that FDA's approval of a biosimilar may  not be made effective until years -- until years  of data exclusivity has run. Two panels of the Federal  Circuit have said that only means made effective. The  FDA certainly could adjudicate a license and grant a  license effective years after, you know, the  exclusivity period runs.  The reason --\",\n",

       "  \" Yes. Now, the -- as -- as my  friend on the other side pointed out, the notion that  38 there is going to be round litigation very early in any event is unlikely for the following reasons. Number one, as they've reported, it takes about years, even for a biosimilar, to get developed. And, you know, Amgen is both a reference product maker and a biosimilar maker, and that's, in fact, consistent with our experience. So the notion that there's going to be, you know, an application filed in year or yearor year is unlikely. Another reason that it's unlikely is these -- these biosimilars -- you know, up until very, very recent advances in gene sequencing, biosimilars were -- the way they were defined was by the process under which they were made. You take a particular cell line and then you do the following things at this atmospheric pressure. And the FDA will not approve a biosimilar until it has inspected the manufacturing process and facilities, which, according to the record, take -- is about 100 or $200 million. And the notion that a biosimilar is going to create a whole factory for the FDA to review and then leave it open for -- until year 12 is quite unlikely. The -- the issue here, even if the FDA took the position that, nope, even though the statute only  39 says that approval can't be made effective, we're not even going to tip our hand until years is over, it still wouldn't defeat the manifest purpose of the statute. This statute, like the Hatch-Waxman Act, has two relevant periods. There is a period of data exclusivity that is the period in which a competitor can't use the sponsor's data. That's not a period of market exclusivity. In fact, there is a competitor to the product at issue in this case that's been on the market for five years because Teva went through the regular 271(A) process. So we have, as in Hatch-Waxman, a period in which there's data exclusivity. And we then have a period, just like in Hatch-Waxman -- there it's 30 months, here it's 180 days -- for the adjudication of any patent disputes. Now, my friends on the other side say, well, this is different because in the Hatch-Waxman context, the FDA actually approves, and then the 30-month period for patent litigation occurs, whereas here, the FDA's approval leaves aside the question of when they can or can't approve it. If they don't approve it until sometime after the years has run, there's an additional 180 days. We don't know that because this has never   happened. But even if it did, the reason why  40  Congress -- the reason why you have to have FDA -- the  FDA say what's being approved, whereas in Hatch-Waxman  you don't, is in Hatch-Waxman we are talking about a  small molecule that has to be identical. It's made by  chemical synthesis, so there's no question.  When -- when a generic asks for Hatch-Waxman  approval, we know precisely what the molecule is. We  know precisely for what therapeutic purposes it will be  used because it has to be identical, and no one cares  what the manufacturing process is because this is simply  chemical synthesis of an identical molecule.  Whereas -- and this goes to Justice Breyer's  question about notice -- until the FDA decides what it  is, what is the compound that it is going to  authorize -- which, by definition, won't be identical --  and until it decides for what therapeutic purposes that  will be used, and until it specifies what the  manufacturing process in what location will be approved,  you can't give notice of anything.  And, if -- in fact, if you look again, we're  on the 180-day notice provision, subsection (a) of  262(l)(8), which -- I'm sorry, I'm looking at my own  appendix, but it's on page 31A of -- of my appendix.  The -- (8)(a) says the Notice of Commercial Marketing.  41 Subsection (b), entitled Preliminary Injunction, tells you the most important consequence of (8)(a) -- and this does go again, I think, Justice Sotomayor, with respect to your question about how soon this can be done -- that (8)(a) notice, first and foremost, allows the sponsor, for the very first time, to seek a preliminary injunction against the commercial marketing of the product for the uses using the processes. And you cannot go to a Federal district court and ask for a preliminary injunction until you know, A, that there's an imminency that occurs. You can't go years in advance. B, you have to know what it is that you are seeking to enjoin. This notion that there's some artificial act of infringement that relates to whatever you may or may not know is in the original application for Article III purposes is irrelevant. I mean, once the FDA -- the -- the question is can you get an injunction against what is approved for what purposes using what processes.

(9)(C) is, if you will, an exception or a clarification  of (9)(A). The background principle is that Congress  has established an artificial act of infringement, which  is the submission of the ABLA, the submission of the  biosimilar application.  That is actionable. There is a Federal  cause of action under Section 281, which gives Federal  district courts jurisdiction to adjudicate patent  disputes. Under the Declaratory-Judgment Act and this  Court's decision in MedImmune v. Genentech, you can  bring a declaratory judgment any time you want so long  as there is a level of immediacy, which, by definition,   there is, if an artificial act of infringement has  47  already occurred.  Now, what (9)(A) says is notwithstanding  those background rules, if the biosimilar applicant  chooses the (k) route and provides the application and  the manufacturing information, we're making an exception  to the general availability of declaratory judgments.  No one can file a declaratory-judgment action until the  notice of commercial marketing is given.  What (9)(C) simply does is it has -- (9)(C)  says if you don't provide that (2)(A) information, you,  the applicant, can't ever file for a  declaratory-judgment action, but (9)(C) doesn't remedy  the sponsor's harm for two reasons.

But let's say the parties decide, okay, we've -- we've each listed all of these patents that are potentially applicable. That list is coherent if the sponsor knows what the application and what manufacturing processes are there for. If we don't know that, we have to list every patent that we have on every manufacturing process that we own, which is incoherent.  57 But let's assume that the parties say, okay, here are the list of patents. How many does it make sense for us to adjudicate now? It certainly makes sense for us to adjudicate the patents on the molecule and perhaps the purposes of the molecule. It may be we think it makes sense to get a court to adjudicate all of them. But even in that instance, number one, under (l) -- the statute in (l)(7) recognizes that the sponsor may well obtain other patents after the lists are exchanged. That has happened in this case. And in the Apotex case that my friend was addressing where they said there are no other patents available, it is about to happen in that case, too, because the -- the PTO has just allowed claims that read on that patent. So, number one, there can be and often will be other patents. Number two, even if you adjudicate -- get an adjudication on the artificial act of infringement, number one, if you follow the process, the sponsor gets a mandatory injunction under 271(d)(4). And in any event, if it turns out that what the FDA has said is, well, you know, there have been a lot of -- we require lots and lots of amendments to the application. In this case they require -- there were 30 amendments made from the time the application was filed until it was granted.  58 If it turns out that when the FDA issues its license, it's licensed something materially different than what the application was, the parties and -- and the district court have to have some opportunity to say, wait a minute, I mean we adjudicated patent infringement on the assumption that the manufacturing process would be X, Y, and Z, but the FDA didn't approve it. They insisted on A, B, and C, and there has to be some period -- and that's what the 180 days does -- to allow the parties to say even with respect to the phase I patents, we now have a real dispute. The FDA has approved something different than what the application was, and the -- the -- the sponsor has to be given some period of time in order to figure out what the FDA has approved, and a district judge has to be given some period of time to evaluate, like what are these patents, what is this compound, what are the manufacturing processes, is -- are the -19\",\n",

       "  ' Thank you, Your Honor. There can be no doubt that the judgment that we\\'ve petitioned on is a Federal judgment. The -- the Federal Circuit issued a Federal injunction and dismissed their State law claims. Two, the -- the statute -- Congress, when it wanted to provide for an injunctive relief of the (l) procedures, it did so. It provided for it in only one  61 instance: Violations of the confidentiality provisions in (l)(1)(H). And significantly, that\\'s also the only provision that Congress called a failure to do something in (l)(1) a violation. Yet, Amgen wants you to read the statute and to read those -- the rest of these provisions as implicitly entitling them to an injunction that Congress chose not to provide, and instead they want to call the remedies Congress did provide as the backup. I -- that\\'s a very odd way to read the statute. The rights here are patent rights. The remedies they were given were patent remedies, and they are forceful. They gave them artificial infringement actions in the case where you participate in an exchange, and in the case where you don\\'t. Congress shows no concern in the notice of commercial marketing provision with notice being too early. It says at least 180 days. And when you lift the gate, it allows the -18 the -- the sponsor to go to court and litigate any remaining patent rights they have. Justice Breyer, the -- Congress knew how to require something to come after one event and before another. It does it in the very next provision, (l)(8)(B). Does not do it in the notice provision. You shouldn\\'t read that requirement into the word \"licensed,\" which is just a description of the   biosimilar.  62  Congress would not have extended the 12-year  exclusivity period in such a bizarre way. That was a  very hotly debated item, and it would extend the  exclusivity period in every case, even when there are no  patent rights to litigate.  Our approach fully allows them to vindicate  their patent rights. We wrote them and we told them to  sue us. Now, they delayed, but they could have sued us  right away. That was the provision Congress allowed.  And in that suit they got our application, they  requested as common in -- in patent cases to request all  of our FDA correspondence. We have a -- a duty to  continue updating them.  They added -- they -- they were issued new  patent during the suit. They have added that patent to  the suit, which is also common in patent litigation.  A lot of what they are telling you blinks  reality about the way the world works, and with respect,  those kinds of policy arguments are for the Congress.  This statute works if you just apply it  according to its terms. The shall conditions are all  conditions precedent, and that\\'s made clear by the  (l)(6) provision which says, they shall sue. It would  be a very odd Federal law to say that is a violation of   Federal law, not to bring suit. It isn\\'t.  63  Congress provided consequences. If they  decide not to sue, then they can only get a reasonable  royalty. These are -- these are shalls, and they do  mean must, but the government says they don\\'t mean must  in all circumstances. They mean must if you want to  continue in this process. And if you don\\'t continue in  the process, there are benefits and burdens to both the  applicant and the sponsor at every step. And if you go  through the statute, and I recognize it\\'s a very  articulated scheme, it\\'s all one coherent whole, and it  gives them a very powerful remedy',\n",
